It is closely related to Emotional Intimacy and Communication Patterns in Relationships, as differences often emerge from how affection is expressed, interpreted, or prioritized. Within a relationship assessment platform, an affection gap is identified by comparing expressed behaviors with perceived emotional needs over time. The concept helps explain compatibility dynamics by separating intent from experience in affectionate exchanges.",
