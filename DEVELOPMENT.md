# Development Guide

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your values

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Environment Setup

### Required for full functionality

| Variable | Purpose | Required for dev? |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Waitlist database | Only for form submissions |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase auth | Only for form submissions |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Email sending | Only for form submissions |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` | Contact form captcha | Only for contact form |
| `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` | Captcha verification | Only for contact form |

### Optional

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SLACK_WAITLIST_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack notifications for waitlist signups |
| `SLACK_CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack notifications for contact form |

**Tip:** You can run the site without any env vars set - the UI will render fine. Forms will fail gracefully with error messages.

## Development vs Production

### CSP (Content Security Policy)

The middleware applies different CSP rules based on environment:

| Directive | Development | Production |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `script-src` | Includes `'unsafe-eval'` for HMR | No `'unsafe-eval'` |
| `connect-src` | Allows `ws://localhost:*` | HTTPS only |
| `upgrade-insecure-requests` | Disabled | Enabled |

This is handled automatically - no configuration needed.

### Third-Party Scripts

In development, these scripts still load but may not function fully without keys:
- **Google Analytics** - Loads but won't track without valid ID
- **CookieYes** - Cookie consent banner loads
- **reCAPTCHA** - Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`

## Common Issues

### Blank sections / CSP errors in dev

If you see `EvalError: call to eval() blocked by CSP` in the console, ensure you're running the latest `middleware.ts` which relaxes CSP in development.

### Form submissions fail with 403

The CSRF token is set via a cookie (`__csrf`). If forms return 403:
1. Clear cookies for localhost
2. Refresh the page (middleware sets the cookie on first request)
3. Try submitting again

### reCAPTCHA not loading

1. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
2. The site key must be registered for `localhost` in Google reCAPTCHA admin
3. Check browser console for CSP or network errors

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Run production build locally
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```
