# Security Guide

## Environment & secrets
- Set all secrets only in Vercel env vars (never in client bundles): `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM`, `RESEND_REPLY_TO`, `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
- Never expose the Supabase service role key to the client; keep all DB access server-side.

## Secrets rotation schedule

| Secret | Rotation | How to rotate |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Quarterly / on incident | Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → Regenerate |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Quarterly / on incident | Resend Dashboard → API Keys → Create new → Delete old |
| `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` | Annually / on incident | Google reCAPTCHA Admin → Settings → Regenerate |
| `SLACK_*_WEBHOOK_URL` | On incident only | Slack App → Incoming Webhooks → Add new → Remove old |

**Rotation checklist:**
1. Generate new key in the service dashboard
2. Update Vercel environment variable
3. Trigger redeploy
4. Verify functionality (test form submissions)
5. Revoke/delete the old key
6. Log the rotation date

**Rotation reminders:** Set calendar reminders for:
- January 1, April 1, July 1, October 1 (quarterly review)

## Monitoring & alerts
- Watch Vercel logs for spikes or 429/500s on `/api/waitlist`.
- Monitor Supabase logs for insert anomalies and rate spikes; enable row-level auditing if available.
- Monitor Resend dashboard for bounce/complaint rates; alert on send failures.
- Add Google Search Console/GA alerts for traffic anomalies.

## Backups & exports
- Export waitlist data regularly from Supabase (CSV or snapshots) and store securely.
- Test restores periodically to ensure data integrity.

## Abuse protection
- Rate limit and cooldown on `/api/waitlist` (in place).
- Honeypot field on forms; consider adding CAPTCHA via env-flagged toggle if abuse increases.
- Keep generic error messages to avoid information disclosure.

## Secure headers & CSP
- Security headers are set in `middleware.ts` with nonce-based CSP (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, CSP).
- If you add new third-party scripts/resources, update CSP in `middleware.ts` accordingly.
- All inline scripts must use the `nonce` prop passed from the layout.
- **SRI (Subresource Integrity):** Google Analytics and reCAPTCHA don't support SRI hashes because their scripts change dynamically. Our nonce-based CSP provides equivalent protection by only allowing scripts with valid nonces to execute.

## Dependencies
- Run `npm audit` regularly; patch high/critical issues. Avoid shipping dev-only tooling to production if not needed.

## Incident response
- On suspected compromise: rotate Supabase/Resend keys, invalidate sessions if added later, redeploy, and review logs. Notify affected users if data exposure is confirmed.
