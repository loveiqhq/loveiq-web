It describes a fear of being left replaced or emotionally abandoned.; Support helps, but it isn’t unlimited. Healthy care includes boundaries.; Jealousy isn’t proof of love. It often signals fear or insecurity.; Boundaries still apply. This doesn’t remove limits.",Core Insecurities; Validation; Anxious Attachment; Situationship,rejection-sensitivity; relationship-security; anxious-attachment; reassurance-needs; emotional-attachment-patterns; trait-disposition
2,Active / Direct Initiation,"An initiation subtype where someone starts intimacy through clear, explicit invitations and straightforward consent language.",Direct initiation can reduce confusion and is especially helpful when partners have different cultural scripts. The growth edge is softness: direct asks work best when they include easy “no” pathways (“totally okay if not”).,Pattern & Dynamic,“Do you want to have sex tonight?”; “Can I kiss you?”; “I’d love intimacy—what feels good for you?”,Sexual Communication & Initiation,General,"Direct equals aggressive; Direct people don’t need emotional context; A direct ask is pressure; If you ask, it can’t be sexy.",Direct can still be kind. Aggression is different from clarity.; That’s not always true. Think of it as an initiation subtype where someone starts intimacy through clear explicit invitations.; Asking isn’t pressure. Consent and pacing still guide.; That’s not always true. It describes an initiation subtype where someone starts intimacy through clear explicit invitations.,Initiation Style; Consent Frameworks; Signal Mismatch,couples-communication; explicit-consent; sexual-communication-initiation; pattern-dynamic
3,Actual Pleasure,"A signal describing the lived quality of pleasure during real intimacy—physical comfort, enjoyment, emotional connection, and satisfaction in the moment.","Actual pleasure can be affected by pain, stress, shame scripts, mismatched pacing, or communication gaps. It’s useful because it points to actionable improvements (slowing down, changing context, better consent check-ins) rather than chasing abstract “scores.” Reports should encourage medical support for persistent pain or dysfunction.",Metric & Measurement,Enjoyment increases with slower pacing; Pleasure drops when anxious or rushed; Satisfaction improves with aftercare and emotional safety.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Pleasure should always be effortless; If pleasure is low, the relationship is doomed; Pleasure equals orgasm only; Pleasure problems are purely psychological.","It can change.

5,Affection Gap,Affection Gap refers to a mismatch between how much affection one person expects or prefers and how much is expressed or perceived within a relationship.,"Affection Gap describes a relational mismatch rather than a lack of care or commitment. It is closely related to Emotional Intimacy and Communication Patterns in Relationships, as differences often emerge from how affection is expressed, interpreted, or prioritized. Within a relationship assessment platform, an affection gap is identified by comparing expressed behaviors with perceived emotional needs over time. The concept helps explain compatibility dynamics by separating intent from experience in affectionate exchanges.",Pattern & Dynamic,One partner prefers frequent physical affection while the other expresses care verbally; A relationship report highlights unequal satisfaction with day-to-day affection; Partners describe feeling loved but not always shown affection in expected ways,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,An affection gap means one partner cares less; An affection gap indicates emotional incompatibility; An affection gap cannot be addressed or understood,Affection Gap doesn’t mean one partner cares less.; It depends.

It’s about actions people take after an intimate or emotionally intense experience.,Boundaries; Emotional Safety; Consent; Intimacy,connection; safety; consent-boundaries; practice-skill
8,Aftercare Dependency,"A pattern where emotional safety and satisfaction depend strongly on aftercare (reassurance, cuddling, debriefing) following intimacy—especially after intense or vulnerable experiences.","Needing aftercare is normal; calling it “dependency” in reports should be handled gently to avoid shame. The goal is clarity: what aftercare helps someone feel safe, and how to negotiate it as a shared ritual. This is especially relevant in exploration/power-play contexts and for people with abandonment or trust insecurities.",Pattern & Dynamic,Needs cuddling and reassurance after sex; Feels anxious if partners separate immediately; Requires a short debrief after intense play to feel settled.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,"Aftercare is childish; If you need aftercare, you’re insecure; Aftercare guarantees consent for future intimacy; If aftercare is requested, the partner must comply indefinitely.",Needing support isn’t childish. Many adults benefit from it.; That’s not always true. Think of it as a pattern where emotional safety and satisfaction depend strongly on aftercare following.; Comfort and consent lead.

10,Anonymized Research Access,Access to research data where identifying details are removed so analysis can be done while reducing privacy risk for individuals.,"In practice, “anonymized access” usually involves strong de-identification plus governance: data minimization, risk review, and rules for cross-border/EU-style privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR-aligned principles). Because true anonymity can be hard to guarantee, responsible programs pair technical controls with legal/ethical guardrails and ongoing monitoring.",Product Artifact,Researchers use a de-identified dataset to study relationship wellbeing trends; A platform shares aggregated survey outcomes with a university partner; A research portal only exposes anonymized outputs and blocks raw exports.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,"Anonymized means “zero risk”; Anonymized equals pseudonymized; Once anonymized, data can be shared freely anywhere; Anonymization removes the need for consent and governance.",Anonymized Research Access doesn’t mean “zero risk”.; It isn’t pseudonymized.

12,Archaic Algorithms,"A metaphor for older, evolution-shaped patterns in attention, attraction, and threat detection that still influence modern desire and relationship behavior.","“Archaic algorithms” refers to fast, automatic mental shortcuts—like novelty-seeking, status sensitivity, or danger scanning—that once helped survival but can misfire in today’s social and digital environments. In sexuality, these shortcuts can amplify comparison, performance pressure, or impulsive cue-reactivity. The goal is awareness and choice, not blaming biology.",Framework & Model,Feeling pulled toward novelty even while valuing commitment; Interpreting a partner’s neutral tone as rejection and losing arousal; Becoming more aroused by “forbidden” contexts because they feel high-stakes.,Desire & Arousal,General,Archaic algorithms mean you can’t control your behavior; They justify jealousy or coercion; Everyone’s algorithms are the same; Modern culture has no effect on desire.,Archaic Algorithms isn’t a control tactic.

13,Archetypal Alignment,"The degree to which a person’s attraction and desire feel “in sync” with recurring symbolic themes (archetypes) they find compelling, such as protector, rebel, nurturer, or explorer.","Archetypal alignment is a way to talk about the stories and roles that make attraction feel meaningful. It can help couples understand why certain dynamics are exciting and others feel flat, without reducing attraction to looks alone. Archetypes are culturally shaped, so the same theme may be expressed differently across regions and media traditions.",Pattern & Dynamic,Someone is most attracted to confident leadership energy and feels bored without it; A person finds tenderness and caretaking deeply erotic; Partners negotiate playful role dynamics that match shared fantasies.,Identity & Attraction,Sensitive,"Archetypes prove there is one “true” partner for you; Alignment is fixed and cannot evolve; Archetypal talk is the same as gender stereotypes; If alignment is low, the relationship has no chance.",It doesn’t guarantee outcomes.

14,Arousal,"Physical and mental signs of sexual activation that are biologically driven and do not necessarily reflect desire, attraction, or consent.","Arousal is a physiological and psychological response that can happen automatically and does not necessarily reflect desire, attraction, or willingness. Because arousal can be influenced by context, stress, or biology, it should never be treated as evidence of consent or intent.",State & Experience,Experiencing physical arousal without wanting sex; feeling mentally interested but not physically aroused; arousal triggered by stress or novelty rather than attraction.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"If I am aroused, I must want sex; arousal always means attraction; lack of arousal means lack of interest.",Not necessarily.

15,Arousal Accelerator,"Arousal Accelerator refers to internal or external factors that increase, intensify, or support sexual or intimate arousal in certain contexts.","Arousal Accelerator describes conditions that facilitate arousal rather than initiate desire on their own. It is closely related to Desire Trigger and Responsive Arousal, as emotional connection, safety, or stimulation can amplify arousal once engagement begins. Within a relationship assessment platform, arousal accelerators are identified through recurring contexts where arousal reliably increases. The concept helps explain compatibility dynamics by distinguishing supportive conditions from baseline desire levels.",Signal & Cue,Arousal increases during emotionally affirming conversations; Feeling relaxed and unpressured amplifies physical responsiveness; A relationship report highlights emotional closeness as a consistent arousal accelerator,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Arousal accelerators mean constant readiness for sex; Arousal accelerators indicate higher libido; Absence of arousal accelerators means lack of attraction,It depends. It describes internal or external factors.; It depends. Think of it as internal or external factors.; It doesn’t mean lack of attraction.

16,Arousal Brake,"Arousal Brake refers to internal or external factors that slow down, inhibit, or interrupt sexual or intimate arousal in certain contexts.","Arousal Brake describes conditions that reduce arousal even when desire or attraction may be present. It is closely related to Desire Inhibition and Emotional Safety, as stress, pressure, or lack of safety can activate inhibitory responses. Within a relationship assessment platform, arousal brakes are identified through patterns where arousal consistently decreases under specific emotional or situational conditions. The concept helps explain compatibility dynamics by distinguishing inhibition from lack of interest or desire.",Signal & Cue,Arousal decreases during periods of unresolved conflict; Performance pressure interrupts physical responsiveness; A relationship report highlights stress as a recurring arousal brake,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Arousal brakes mean no sexual attraction; Arousal brakes indicate personal failure; Arousal brakes are permanent and unchangeable,Not necessarily.

17,Arousal Curve,"A simplified shape of how arousal typically rises and falls over time for a person, including warm-up, peak, and recovery phases.","Arousal curves help people communicate what “too fast” or “too slow” feels like. Curves can change with stress, health, relationship safety, and life stage. Reports should encourage curiosity and experimentation without turning the curve into a rigid rule, and reinforce consent at each phase.",Metric & Measurement,Gradual build with a long plateau; Quick rise and fast drop if interrupted; Multiple waves rather than one peak; Needing recovery time after high intensity.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Arousal should look the same for everyone; One curve is the only healthy curve; If your curve changes, attraction is gone; The curve predicts consent.","That’s not always true. It describes a simplified shape of how arousal typically rises and falls over time.; One curve isn’t always the only healthy curve.; If your curve changes, attraction isn’t always gone.; Consent comes first.

18,Arousal Map,"Arousal Map refers to a structured representation of the emotional, relational, and situational factors that influence how sexual or intimate arousal emerges for a person","Arousal Map describes how different conditions interact to support or inhibit arousal across contexts. It integrates elements such as Arousal Brake, Arousal Accelerator, and Emotional Intimacy to show patterns rather than single triggers. Within a relationship assessment platform, an arousal map is inferred from recurring responses to stress, connection, and stimulation. The concept helps explain compatibility dynamics by visualizing when arousal is most accessible and when it is constrained.",Framework & Model,"A relationship report visualizes stress as an inhibitor and emotional closeness as a facilitator of arousal; Patterns show arousal emerging mainly during relaxed, connected moments; An assessment highlights different arousal maps between partners",Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,An arousal map determines overall sexual desire; An arousal map is fixed and unchangeable; An arousal map predicts relationship success,That’s not always true.

19,Arousal Non-Concordance,"A common mismatch where genital response and subjective (felt) arousal do not align (the body reacts without desire, or desire exists without strong genital response).","Non-concordance is normal and especially important for consent clarity: genital response is not the same as wanting, agreeing, or feeling safe. Stress, medication, trauma history, context, and meaning can all affect alignment. Reports should use non-shaming language and encourage explicit check-ins rather than assumptions.",Pattern & Dynamic,Lubrication/erection without feeling turned on; Feeling mentally aroused while the body is slow to respond; Genital response fades when anxiety rises even with attraction present.,Consent & Boundaries,Highly Sensitive,"If the body responds, consent is automatic; Non-concordance means you’re broken; It only happens after trauma; Mismatch proves you don’t like your partner.",Consent comes first.

20,Arousal Style,"A person’s typical pattern for how sexual arousal starts, builds, and stays present across different contexts and partners.","Arousal style describes the “how” of getting turned on: pacing, preferred initiation, sensory intensity, and what helps someone stay engaged. It can shift with stress, hormones, health, relationship safety, and life stage, but many people notice repeating themes. Mapping arousal style helps partners reduce guesswork and communicate more clearly about libido, turn-ons, and turn-offs.",Trait & Disposition,Someone needs slow build-up and emotional connection before arousal rises; A person’s arousal spikes quickly with novelty but drops if they feel rushed; Arousal is strongest with cuddling first and plenty of privacy.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Arousal style is the same as sexual orientation; If your arousal style differs from your partner’s you are incompatible; Arousal style never changes; Arousal style can be forced with willpower.,Arousal Style isn’t sexual orientation. It describes a person’s typical pattern for how sexual arousal starts builds and stays.; Difference isn’t automatic incompatibility. Many gaps improve with communication.; It can vary.

21,Arousal Window,"Arousal Window refers to the range of emotional, mental, and physical conditions in which sexual or intimate arousal is most accessible for a person.","Arousal Window describes when arousal is most likely to emerge rather than how strong desire is overall. It is closely related to Arousal Brake and Arousal Accelerator, as both influence whether conditions fall inside or outside this window. Within a relationship assessment platform, the arousal window is identified by patterns showing optimal timing, emotional state, and context for arousal. The concept helps explain compatibility dynamics by clarifying why arousal may feel available in some situations and blocked in others.",Framework & Model,"Arousal is more accessible during relaxed, emotionally connected moments; Stress narrows the arousal window despite underlying attraction; A relationship report highlights different arousal windows between partners",Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Arousal window reflects overall sexual desire; Arousal window is fixed and unchangeable; Arousal window determines relationship compatibility,Not necessarily.

24,Attentional Focus,"Where attention naturally goes during intimacy (body sensations, partner cues, thoughts, worries, fantasy), shaping arousal and pleasure.","Attention is a key lever: self-monitoring and worry can activate arousal brakes, while present-moment attention supports pleasure and consent clarity. Reports should keep this practical (reduce distractions, slow down, check-in) and avoid implying people can “force” attention. Cultural factors like privacy and stress exposure affect focus.",Metric & Measurement,Getting distracted by performance thoughts; Feeling most aroused when focused on touch; Using fantasy to stay engaged; Losing arousal when worrying about being judged.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Focus problems mean you don’t want your partner; Attention can be controlled instantly; If you think about anything else, consent is unclear; Focus is only a mindfulness issue.","That’s not always true.

25,Attraction Spectrum,"Attraction Spectrum refers to the range and variability of how attraction is experienced, expressed, and felt across different emotional, physical, or situational contexts.","Attraction Spectrum describes attraction as a continuum rather than a fixed or binary state. It is closely related to Sexual Desire and Emotional Intimacy, as attraction can shift in intensity, focus, or expression over time. Within a relationship assessment platform, the attraction spectrum is inferred from patterns of interest, engagement, and responsiveness across contexts. The concept helps explain compatibility dynamics by distinguishing attraction variability from attraction absence or certainty.",Framework & Model,Attraction feels stronger during periods of emotional closeness; Interest fluctuates depending on context rather than disappearing; A relationship report highlights different attraction patterns between partners,Identity & Attraction,General,Attraction spectrum means uncertainty about attraction; Attraction spectrum reflects lack of commitment; Attraction spectrum defines identity or orientation,Attraction Spectrum doesn’t mean uncertainty about attraction.; That’s not always true.

26,Autonomic Nervous System (ANS),"The part of the nervous system that automatically regulates arousal states such as fight/flight, rest/digest, and physiological readiness for intimacy.","The ANS influences sexual response through stress hormones, muscle tone, breathing, and blood flow. When the system reads “unsafe,” inhibition rises; when it reads “safe,” connection and arousal are easier. Understanding the ANS supports practical interventions like reducing stress, improving privacy, and building emotional safety.",Data & Research Method,A person’s desire increases when they feel relaxed and unhurried; Conflict triggers a stress response that makes arousal difficult; Gentle touch and reassurance help someone shift into a calmer state before intimacy.,Desire & Arousal,General,"ANS regulation is the same as “being calm all the time”; If your ANS is activated, you cannot consent; Nervous-system language excuses hurtful behavior; ANS concepts are only relevant for clinical therapy.",Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) isn’t “being calm all the time”.

27,Autonomy Need,"Autonomy Need refers to the degree to which a person requires independence, personal space, and self-direction within a relationship.","Autonomy Need reflects how individuals balance closeness with independence in relational dynamics. It is closely connected to Attachment Style and Emotional Intimacy, as differing autonomy preferences influence comfort with proximity, decision-making, and emotional reliance. Within a relationship assessment platform, autonomy need is inferred from patterns around boundaries, responsiveness, and time spent apart. Understanding this need supports relationship insights by clarifying compatibility dynamics without framing independence as emotional distance.",Need & Preference,One partner feels recharged by time alone while remaining emotionally connected; A relationship report highlights mismatched needs for personal space; Communication patterns show tension around availability and independence,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,Autonomy need means avoiding commitment; Autonomy need signals emotional withdrawal; Autonomy need reduces emotional intimacy,Autonomy Need doesn’t mean avoiding commitment.

28,Avoidant Attachment,"A pattern marked by stronger need for independence and privacy, sometimes withdrawing under pressure or emotional intensity.","This pattern often benefits from low-pressure invitations, predictable routines, and respect for space. It does not mean low love or low sexuality; it often means safety increases when autonomy is honored. Reporting should offer consent-friendly reconnection steps and avoid blame.",Trait & Disposition,Needing time alone after conflict; Discomfort with intense emotional conversations during initiation; Prefers gradual escalation and clear boundaries.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,Avoidant means cold or uncaring; Avoidant people can’t do commitment; The solution is to push for more closeness; Avoidant attachment removes the need for consent clarity.,Avoidant Attachment doesn’t mean cold or uncaring.; That’s not always true.

29,Awakening / Exploring,"A stage where curiosity and desire begin to return, and someone explores preferences, turn-ons, and boundaries with growing confidence.","This stage is often marked by learning: naming accelerators/brakes, trying gentle experiments, and improving communication. It benefits from clear consent frameworks and culturally sensitive language that normalizes questions without pushing beyond comfort.",State & Experience,"Trying new ways of initiating without pressure; Exploring fantasy themes as “story,” not demands; Learning which contexts (privacy, time) make arousal easier.","Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Sensitive,Exploring means you must be adventurous; Exploration equals boundary-pushing; Curiosity proves dissatisfaction with a partner; Exploration removes the need for consent.,Awakening / Exploring doesn’t mean you must be adventurous.; Boundaries still apply. This doesn’t remove limits.; Not necessarily. It describes a stage where curiosity and desire begin to return and someone explores.; Consent comes first. Nothing overrides it.,Curiosity & Exploration Orientation; Consent Frameworks; Reflective Prompts; Arousal Style; Ethical Containment,consent-first; fantasy-kink-exploration; state-experience
30,Base Code (Evolutionary Ethology),"A shorthand for evolution-informed patterns in mating, bonding, and social behavior that shape human sexuality across many cultures and contexts.","Ethology studies behavior in natural settings; in this glossary, “base code” refers to recurring drives like attachment, status, novelty, pair-bonding, and caregiving. These patterns interact with personal history and culture, so they’re tendencies, not rules.

It is closely related to Desire Initiation and Emotional Intimacy, as desire often emerges in response to feeling connected, relaxed, or emotionally seen. Within a relationship assessment platform, desire triggers are identified by recurring contexts or interactions associated with increased desire. The concept helps clarify compatibility dynamics by distinguishing activation conditions from baseline desire levels.",Signal & Cue,Desire increases after emotionally meaningful conversations; Feeling appreciated acts as a consistent trigger for intimacy; A relationship report highlights differing desire triggers between partners,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,Desire triggers are purely physical; Desire triggers determine overall sexual compatibility; Desire triggers are identical for everyone,Not necessarily.

75,Dual Control Model of Sexual Response,"A research-backed model that explains sexual arousal as the balance between excitation (accelerators) and inhibition (brakes), shaped by context, meaning, and safety.","The Dual Control Model is often used to normalize why desire varies: the same person can feel highly sexual in one context and shut down in another. It supports practical troubleshooting by identifying accelerators to add and brakes to reduce, rather than blaming libido or compatibility. The model is used internationally in sex research and therapy, though it should be applied with cultural humility and individual nuance.",Framework & Model,A couple improves sex by reducing stress triggers (brakes) and adding playful initiation (accelerators); Someone notices arousal is easier on vacation than during work deadlines; A person realizes privacy concerns are a stronger brake than attraction is an accelerator.,Desire & Arousal,General,"The model means arousal is purely mechanical; If you add enough accelerators, consent is automatic; Brakes are always trauma-related; The model replaces communication about needs and boundaries.","Dual Control Model of Sexual Response doesn’t mean arousal is purely mechanical.

77,Embodied Confidence,"A pattern where sexual confidence comes from body awareness, comfort with sensation, and ability to pace and communicate in the moment.","Embodied confidence is supported by presence, somatic integration, and consent skills.

101,Expressive & Performative,"A communication style that uses emotion, storytelling, flirtation, and energetic expression to convey desire, interest, or boundaries.","This style can feel romantic and motivating, and it often thrives on praise, tone, and atmosphere.

188,Presence vs Performance,"A common tension in intimacy between being present and attuned versus focusing on doing it ""right,"" meeting expectations, or achieving outcomes.","Performance focus often activates arousal brakes (self-monitoring, fear of judgment) and reduces pleasure. Presence emphasizes attention to sensation, connection, and consent in the moment.
