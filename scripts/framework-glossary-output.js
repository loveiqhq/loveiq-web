  "type": "Practice & Skill",
  "category": "frameworks",
  "definition": "The capacity to make deliberate, values-aligned choices in relationships and sexuality, including learning, boundary-setting, and behavior change over time.",
  "extendedNotes": "Agency supports healthier intimacy by shifting from “this just happens to me” to “I can choose my pace, communicate needs, and build skills.” It’s especially important in taboo-heavy contexts because it empowers respectful self-definition while maintaining consent and non-harm principles.",
  "examples": [
    "Choosing to pause when unsure instead of pushing through",

  "category": "frameworks",
  "definition": "Privacy techniques that reduce detail by summarizing data (aggregation) or converting precise values into broader buckets (coarsening).",
  "extendedNotes": "These techniques lower re-identification risk while keeping analytic value, especially for geo reporting (country/region comparisons). Coarsening should be done thoughtfully to avoid distorting outcomes or hiding meaningful disparities; documentation helps users interpret results correctly.",
  "examples": [

  "type": "Product Artifact",
  "category": "frameworks",
  "definition": "A structured snapshot showing how a person’s traits, needs, and preferences align with one or more relational or erotic patterns in a matching framework.",
  "extendedNotes": "Alignment profiles are often generated from surveys or guided self-assessments and can help people see strengths, friction points, and negotiation areas. They are best used as conversation starters, not as labels or diagnoses. Good profiles include uncertainty, cultural context, and actionable suggestions rather than rigid scores.",
  "examples": [
    "A report highlights high match on communication style but mismatch on sexual frequency expectations",
    "A couple uses a profile to discuss boundaries and turn-on cues",

  "category": "frameworks",
  "definition": "Access to research data where identifying details are removed so analysis can be done while reducing privacy risk for individuals.",
  "extendedNotes": "In practice, “anonymized access” usually involves strong de-identification plus governance: data minimization, risk review, and rules for cross-border/EU-style privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR-aligned principles). Because true anonymity can be hard to guarantee, responsible programs pair technical controls with legal/ethical guardrails and ongoing monitoring.",
  "examples": [
    "Researchers use a de-identified dataset to study relationship wellbeing trends",

  "type": "Framework & Model",
  "category": "frameworks",
  "definition": "A metaphor for older, evolution-shaped patterns in attention, attraction, and threat detection that still influence modern desire and relationship behavior.",
  "extendedNotes": "“Archaic algorithms” refers to fast, automatic mental shortcuts—like novelty-seeking, status sensitivity, or danger scanning—that once helped survival but can misfire in today’s social and digital environments. In sexuality, these shortcuts can amplify comparison, performance pressure, or impulsive cue-reactivity. The goal is awareness and choice, not blaming biology.",
  "examples": [
    "Feeling pulled toward novelty even while valuing commitment",

  "category": "pattern",
  "definition": "The degree to which a person’s attraction and desire feel “in sync” with recurring symbolic themes (archetypes) they find compelling, such as protector, rebel, nurturer, or explorer.",
  "extendedNotes": "Archetypal alignment is a way to talk about the stories and roles that make attraction feel meaningful. It can help couples understand why certain dynamics are exciting and others feel flat, without reducing attraction to looks alone. Archetypes are culturally shaped, so the same theme may be expressed differently across regions and media traditions.",
  "examples": [
    "Someone is most attracted to confident leadership energy and feels bored without it",
    "A person finds tenderness and caretaking deeply erotic",
    "Partners negotiate playful role dynamics that match shared fantasies."

  "term": "Archetypal Probabilities",
  "slug": "archetypal-probabilities",
  "type": "Data & Research Method",
  "category": "frameworks",
  "definition": "A way of thinking about attraction as likelihoods: certain archetypal themes and dynamics are more or less probable to feel erotic for a given person based on history, culture, and temperament.",
  "extendedNotes": "This term is useful for exploration: instead of treating preferences as mysterious, people can test hypotheses about what themes reliably increase arousal or emotional connection. It also avoids rigid labels by emphasizing probabilities rather than certainties. Because media and culture influence archetypes, it encourages checking whether a preference is personally authentic or socially inherited.",
  "examples": [
    "Noticing you’re more likely to feel desire when there’s playful challenge than when everything is predictable",
    "Experimenting with different initiation styles to see what themes land",

  "type": "Metric & Measurement",
  "category": "frameworks",
  "definition": "A probability-based output that shows how strongly a person’s profile matches multiple archetypes, expressed as a distribution across options.",
  "extendedNotes": "A distribution can be peaked (one clear match) or broad (several plausible matches). Showing a distribution can reduce over-labeling by making ambiguity visible. For geo/cross-cultural use, it helps to include plain-language explanations so probabilities don’t get misread as identity categories.",
  "examples": [
    "A user sees 55% Explorer, 30% Connector, 15% Stabilizer",
    "Two archetypes are close, prompting reflection rather than a single label",

  "category": "frameworks",
  "definition": "A full probability profile showing how strongly a person matches each archetype, represented as a distribution rather than a single label.",
  "extendedNotes": "Full signatures help prevent over-labeling by showing nuance (e.g., two close matches). They’re especially useful in multicultural settings because they allow “both/and” interpretations and can be paired with plain-language explanations, uncertainty notes, and guardrails to avoid identity-like claims.",
  "examples": [
    "A user sees probabilities across 8 archetypes rather than one winner",
    "A report highlights top 3 archetypes plus “close alternatives”",

  "extendedNotes": "Prototype profiles can be created from theory, expert design, or aggregated user data, and they should be reviewed for bias and cultural fit. They help people understand “which pattern you resemble most” without forcing a single label. Good products also show confidence levels and alternative close matches.",
  "examples": [

  "category": "pattern",
  "definition": "A situation where genital arousal and felt mental arousal do not match (for example, the body reacts while the person feels emotionally unaroused—or vice versa).",
  "extendedNotes": "Non-concordance is common and not a sign of deception or dysfunction on its own. Genital response can be triggered by friction, novelty, or automatic physiology, while subjective arousal depends strongly on meaning, safety, and desire. Understanding non-concordance supports consent clarity: bodily reactions are not the same as wanting or agreeing.",
  "examples": [
    "Someone experiences lubrication/erection without feeling desire",

  "extendedNotes": "Arousal style describes the “how” of getting turned on: pacing, preferred initiation, sensory intensity, and what helps someone stay engaged. It can shift with stress, hormones, health, relationship safety, and life stage, but many people notice repeating themes. Mapping arousal style helps partners reduce guesswork and communicate more clearly about libido, turn-ons, and turn-offs.",
  "examples": [
    "Someone needs slow build-up and emotional connection before arousal rises",

  "definition": "The part of the nervous system that automatically regulates arousal states such as fight/flight, rest/digest, and physiological readiness for intimacy.",
  "extendedNotes": "The ANS influences sexual response through stress hormones, muscle tone, breathing, and blood flow. When the system reads “unsafe,” inhibition rises; when it reads “safe,” connection and arousal are easier. Understanding the ANS supports practical interventions like reducing stress, improving privacy, and building emotional safety.",

  "definition": "A shorthand for evolution-informed patterns in mating, bonding, and social behavior that shape human sexuality across many cultures and contexts.",
  "extendedNotes": "Ethology studies behavior in natural settings; in this glossary, “base code” refers to recurring drives like attachment, status, novelty, pair-bonding, and caregiving. These patterns interact with personal history and culture, so they’re tendencies, not rules. Using the concept responsibly means staying away from stereotypes and focusing on individual variation.",

  "extendedNotes": "Reward dynamics often involve dopamine-linked motivation, bonding chemistry (often discussed via oxytocin/vasopressin), and comfort/pleasure pathways (endogenous opioids). These systems interact with learning and context, so they do not determine behavior on their own. The concept is useful for explaining why novelty can feel exciting, why safety can increase desire, and why stress can blunt pleasure—across many cultures and life stages.",

  "type": "Pattern & Dynamic",
  "category": "pattern",
  "definition": "A widespread shortfall in sexual education that leaves many people without practical, evidence-based knowledge about bodies, consent, pleasure, and healthy relationship skills.",
  "extendedNotes": "A systemic education gap is not just “missing information”—it often creates myths, shame, and unrealistic expectations that shape adult intimacy and communication. The size and content of the gap varies by country, school system, and community, but the outcome is similar: people learn from peers, porn, or trial-and-error instead of guided, accurate learning. Closing the gap usually involves normalizing questions, teaching consent and anatomy, and building communication skills.",
  "examples": [
    "Adults who never learned accurate anatomy and struggle to describe what feels good",
    "Partners who assume consent is “obvious” because no one taught explicit boundary skills",
    "People who feel confused about arousal changes across the lifespan because education focused only on reproduction."
