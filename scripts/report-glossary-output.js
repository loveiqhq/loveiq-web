  "slug": "wave-based-arousal",
  "type": "Pattern & Dynamic",
  "category": "pattern",
  "definition": "An arousal pattern where desire builds and ebbs in waves, often needing sustained safety, time, and attunement rather than quick triggers.",
  "extendedNotes": "Wave-based arousal often benefits from slow pacing, emotional safety, and reduced performance pressure. It can be especially common in long-term partnerships and during life stages with high stress or low privacy. Reports should highlight that waves are normal and can be very pleasurable—without needing a single “peak.”",
  "examples": [
    "Arousal builds gradually during extended touch",
    "Desire returns in cycles during intimacy",
    "Needs time and privacy to crest",
    "Enjoys longer, connected sessions."

    "Wave arousal is low libido",
    "If it takes time, attraction is missing",
    "Waves should lead to orgasm every time",
