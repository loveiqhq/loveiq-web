1,Abandonment Insecurity,Trait & Disposition,"A fear of being left, replaced, or emotionally abandoned, which can intensify reassurance needs and sensitivity to distance.","This insecurity can amplify reactions to slow replies, reduced sex, or ambiguous signals. Healthy support includes explicit agreements, consistent connection rituals, and learning self-regulation strategies—without using guilt or pressure to force closeness.",Panicking when a partner seems distant; Interpreting “not tonight” as rejection; Seeking frequent proof of commitment or desire.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Highly Sensitive,"Abandonment insecurity equals manipulation; The partner must provide unlimited reassurance; Jealousy proves love; If someone is anxious, boundaries don’t matter.",Core Insecurities; Validation; Anxious Attachment; Situationship,abandonment-fear; reassurance-needs; anxious-attachment; rejection-sensitivity; relationship-security
2,Active / Direct Initiation,Pattern & Dynamic,"An initiation subtype where someone starts intimacy through clear, explicit invitations and straightforward consent language.",Direct initiation can reduce confusion and is especially helpful when partners have different cultural scripts. The growth edge is softness: direct asks work best when they include easy “no” pathways (“totally okay if not”).,“Do you want to have sex tonight?”; “Can I kiss you?”; “I’d love intimacy—what feels good for you?”,Sexual Communication & Initiation,General,"Direct equals aggressive; Direct people don’t need emotional context; A direct ask is pressure; If you ask, it can’t be sexy.",Initiation Style; Consent Frameworks; Signal Mismatch,direct-initiation; explicit-consent; clear-asks; initiation-skills; couples-communication
3,Actual Pleasure,Metric & Measurement,"A report signal describing the lived quality of pleasure during real intimacy—physical comfort, enjoyment, emotional connection, and satisfaction in the moment.","Actual pleasure can be affected by pain, stress, shame scripts, mismatched pacing, or communication gaps. It’s useful because it points to actionable improvements (slowing down, changing context, better consent check-ins) rather than chasing abstract “scores.” Reports should encourage medical support for persistent pain or dysfunction.",Enjoyment increases with slower pacing; Pleasure drops when anxious or rushed; Satisfaction improves with aftercare and emotional safety.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Pleasure should always be effortless; If pleasure is low, the relationship is doomed; Pleasure equals orgasm only; Pleasure problems are purely psychological.",Presence vs Performance; Optimal Sexual States; Aftercare; Arousal Brake,actual-pleasure; sexual-satisfaction; comfort; intimacy-quality; pleasure-skills
4,Adrenaline,Data & Research Method,A hormone (epinephrine) linked to activation and excitement that can sometimes amplify arousal—but can also increase anxiety depending on context.,"Adrenaline can feel like “spark” in flirting or novelty, but if the nervous system reads a situation as unsafe, the same activation can become anxiety and shut down desire. Reporting should emphasize consent and safety: excitement works best when it’s chosen and contained.",Feeling turned on by thrill and anticipation; Novelty makes arousal spike; Activation turns into anxiety when pressure or fear is present.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Adrenaline is required for good sex; Thrill equals love; If you don’t feel excited, you’re incompatible; Adrenaline excuses risky behavior.",Novelty; Flow States; Arousal Accelerator; Arousal Brake; Biochemical Reward System Dynamics,adrenaline; excitement; thrill; nervous-system-activation; arousal
5,Aftercare Dependency,Pattern & Dynamic,"A pattern where emotional safety and satisfaction depend strongly on aftercare (reassurance, cuddling, debriefing) following intimacy—especially after intense or vulnerable experiences.","Needing aftercare is normal; calling it “dependency” in reports should be handled gently to avoid shame. The goal is clarity: what aftercare helps someone feel safe, and how to negotiate it as a shared ritual. This is especially relevant in exploration/power-play contexts and for people with abandonment or trust insecurities.",Needs cuddling and reassurance after sex; Feels anxious if partners separate immediately; Requires a short debrief after intense play to feel settled.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,"Aftercare is childish; If you need aftercare, you’re insecure; Aftercare guarantees consent for future intimacy; If aftercare is requested, the partner must comply indefinitely.",Aftercare; Being Safe; Abandonment Insecurity; Power Exchange,aftercare-needs; post-sex-care; reassurance; emotional-safety; kink-aftercare; relationship-security
6,Anxious Attachment,Trait & Disposition,"A report pattern marked by higher sensitivity to rejection and stronger reassurance needs, which can impact desire, initiation, and conflict cycles.","This pattern can intensify validation needs and performance anxiety, especially when communication is ambiguous. Support focuses on clear agreements, consistent reassurance, and self-regulation skills—without using pressure or guilt to secure closeness.",Increased worry after a slow text reply; Seeking reassurance before intimacy feels safe; Pursue-withdraw cycles around closeness.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,Anxious means needy or manipulative; Anxiety guarantees relationship failure; The partner must provide unlimited reassurance; Anxious attachment excuses boundary violations.,Core Insecurities; Validation; Relational Loops; Consent Frameworks,anxious-attachment; reassurance-needs; rejection-sensitivity; relationship-anxiety; closeness
7,Arousal Breaks,Framework & Model,"Report shorthand for factors that inhibit arousal (often called “arousal brakes”), reducing responsiveness, pleasure, or desire in the moment.","Arousal breaks/brakes can be internal (anxiety, shame, fatigue) or external (lack of privacy, pressure, conflict). This concept helps users troubleshoot without blame: the goal is to reduce inhibition and increase safety/presence, not to force outcomes. In sensitive contexts, pair this with consent frameworks and non-harm language.",Stress makes arousal hard even with attraction; Pressure to perform shuts down desire; Low privacy blocks arousal; Negative self-talk interrupts pleasure.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"If you have brakes, you’re broken; Brakes prove incompatibility; Brakes can be overridden by persistence; Brakes don’t matter in committed relationships.",Arousal Brake; Turn-Offs; Cortisol; Presence vs Performance; State Optimization,arousal-brakes; arousal-breaks; sexual-inhibition; libido-blockers; stress-and-desire; couples-tools
8,Arousal Curve,Metric & Measurement,"A simplified shape of how arousal typically rises and falls over time for a person, including warm-up, peak, and recovery phases.","Arousal curves help people communicate what “too fast” or “too slow” feels like. Curves can change with stress, health, relationship safety, and life stage. Reports should encourage curiosity and experimentation without turning the curve into a rigid rule, and reinforce consent at each phase.",Gradual build with a long plateau; Quick rise and fast drop if interrupted; Multiple waves rather than one peak; Needing recovery time after high intensity.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Arousal should look the same for everyone; One curve is the only healthy curve; If your curve changes, attraction is gone; The curve predicts consent.",Pacing & Arousal Curve; Spike-Based Arousal; Wave-Based Arousal; State Optimization,arousal-curve; sexual-response; arousal-pattern; libido-shape; intimacy-science; couples-communication
9,Arousal Non-Concordance,Pattern & Dynamic,"A common mismatch where genital response and subjective (felt) arousal do not align (the body reacts without desire, or desire exists without strong genital response).","Non-concordance is normal and especially important for consent clarity: genital response is not the same as wanting, agreeing, or feeling safe. Stress, medication, trauma history, context, and meaning can all affect alignment. Reports should use non-shaming language and encourage explicit check-ins rather than assumptions.",Lubrication/erection without feeling turned on; Feeling mentally aroused while the body is slow to respond; Genital response fades when anxiety rises even with attraction present.,Consent & Boundaries,Highly Sensitive,"If the body responds, consent is automatic; Non-concordance means you’re broken; It only happens after trauma; Mismatch proves you don’t like your partner.",Genital; Subjective; Consent Frameworks; Presence vs Performance,arousal-nonconcordance; mind-body-mismatch; consent-clarity; genital-response; sexual-safety
10,Arousal Style,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing how sexual arousal typically starts, builds, and stays present for a person across contexts.","Arousal style includes pacing, preferred initiation, and sensitivity to accelerators (turn-ons) and brakes (turn-offs). It often shifts with stress, health, and relationship safety, so reports should frame it as a pattern—not a fixed identity. Knowing arousal style helps partners reduce guesswork and create better conditions for consent and pleasure.",Needs slow build-up and emotional connection; Arousal spikes with novelty but drops when rushed; Prefers touch-first initiation with privacy and time.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Arousal style is the same as sexual orientation; If arousal style differs, you’re incompatible; Arousal style never changes; If the body reacts, consent is automatic.",Body-First Arousal; Presence vs Performance; Cortisol; Novelty; Consent Frameworks,arousal-style; libido-pattern; turn-ons; turn-offs; sexual-response; relationship-compatibility
11,Attentional Focus,Metric & Measurement,"Where attention naturally goes during intimacy (body sensations, partner cues, thoughts, worries, fantasy), shaping arousal and pleasure.","Attention is a key lever: self-monitoring and worry can activate arousal brakes, while present-moment attention supports pleasure and consent clarity. Reports should keep this practical (reduce distractions, slow down, check-in) and avoid implying people can “force” attention. Cultural factors like privacy and stress exposure affect focus.",Getting distracted by performance thoughts; Feeling most aroused when focused on touch; Using fantasy to stay engaged; Losing arousal when worrying about being judged.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Focus problems mean you don’t want your partner; Attention can be controlled instantly; If you think about anything else, consent is unclear; Focus is only a mindfulness issue.",Presence vs Performance; Embodied Integration; Performance Anxiety; Flow States,attentional-focus; sexual-presence; distraction; performance-anxiety; mindfulness; intimacy-quality
12,Autonomic Nervous System,Data & Research Method,"The body’s automatic regulation system (sympathetic and parasympathetic) that shapes stress, safety, arousal, and sexual responsiveness.","The ANS helps explain why stress can shut down desire (high threat activation) and why safety cues can support arousal and pleasure. It links directly to pacing, presence, and embodied integration. Reports should keep this practical: sleep, privacy, recovery, and emotional safety often matter more than “trying harder.”",Arousal is easier when relaxed and safe; Desire drops during chronic stress; Slow breathing and decompression improve presence before intimacy.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"The nervous system is an excuse; ANS concepts replace consent; If you regulate stress, desire is guaranteed; ANS means problems are purely biological.",Cortisol; State Optimization; Embodied Integration; Arousal Brake,autonomic-nervous-system; stress-regulation; safety-cues; libido-and-stress; wellbeing
13,Avoidant Attachment,Trait & Disposition,"A report pattern marked by stronger need for independence and privacy, sometimes withdrawing under pressure or emotional intensity.","This pattern often benefits from low-pressure invitations, predictable routines, and respect for space. It does not mean low love or low sexuality; it often means safety increases when autonomy is honored. Reporting should offer consent-friendly reconnection steps and avoid blame.",Needing time alone after conflict; Discomfort with intense emotional conversations during initiation; Prefers gradual escalation and clear boundaries.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,Avoidant means cold or uncaring; Avoidant people can’t do commitment; The solution is to push for more closeness; Avoidant attachment removes the need for consent clarity.,Quiet Withdrawer; Emotional Safety; Boundaries; Relational Loops,avoidant-attachment; autonomy; privacy; withdraw-pattern; pacing
14,Awakening / Exploring,State & Experience,"A stage where curiosity and desire begin to return, and someone explores preferences, turn-ons, and boundaries with growing confidence.","This stage is often marked by learning: naming accelerators/brakes, trying gentle experiments, and improving communication. It benefits from clear consent frameworks and culturally sensitive language that normalizes questions without pushing beyond comfort.","Trying new ways of initiating without pressure; Exploring fantasy themes as “story,” not demands; Learning which contexts (privacy, time) make arousal easier.","Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Sensitive,Exploring means you must be adventurous; Exploration equals boundary-pushing; Curiosity proves dissatisfaction with a partner; Exploration removes the need for consent.,Curiosity & Exploration Orientation; Consent Frameworks; Reflective Prompts; Arousal Style; Ethical Containment,awakening; exploring; sexual-curiosity; discovery; consent-first
15,Being Chosen,Signal & Cue,"A desire driver where commitment, exclusivity, and feeling prioritized (emotionally or romantically) increase arousal and satisfaction.","“Being chosen” often shows up as wanting clarity: labels, agreements, and follow-through. It can be especially strong for people with abandonment insecurity or in situationships. Geo context matters because public commitment signals vary by culture; reports should focus on consent-based agreements and consistent actions, not social performance.",Desire rises after exclusivity talk; Feeling aroused by loyalty and devotion; Arousal drops in ambiguous dating stages; Commitment rituals increase safety and desire.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,"Being chosen means controlling a partner; Exclusivity guarantees compatibility; If you need commitment, you’re insecure; Commitment replaces consent in the moment.",Relationship Form Preference; Monogamy; Abandonment Insecurity; Relational Orientation,being-chosen; exclusivity; commitment; relationship-clarity; dating-security; global-relationships
16,Being Safe,Signal & Cue,"A desire driver where emotional and physical safety cues (trust, permission, privacy, non-pressure) are the main pathway into arousal and openness.","This is one of the most universal drivers across cultures: when people feel safe, arousal brakes lessen and presence increases. Safety includes consent clarity, predictable respect for boundaries, and repair after ruptures. Reports should highlight actionable safety cues (tone, pacing, privacy) rather than vague advice.",Desire increases after reassurance and repair; Arousal rises when there’s privacy and time; Pressure kills desire; Clear “no is okay” language supports openness.,Consent & Boundaries,Sensitive,"Needing safety means low attraction; Safety guarantees sex; If you’re in a relationship, safety is automatic; Safety means avoiding all discomfort forever.",Emotional Safety; Consent Frameworks; State Optimization; Trust and Safety Insecurity,being-safe; emotional-safety; consent-first; trust; libido-and-stress; relationship-security
17,Being Seen,Signal & Cue,"A desire driver where feeling noticed, admired, and emotionally recognized strongly increases arousal and satisfaction.","“Being seen” can be sexual (compliments, gaze) or emotional (feeling understood). It often overlaps with validation-based arousal and can be intensified by cultural scripts around shame and desirability. Reports should emphasize consent and boundaries: admiration should never become pressure or evaluation.",Praise and attention increase desire; Feeling desired through eye contact; Arousal rises when a partner names what they appreciate.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,"Being seen equals needing constant validation; Compliments should override boundaries; If you need to be seen, you’re insecure; Being seen is only about looks.",Validation; Being Chosen; Approval Seeker; Exhibitionist Performer,being-seen; feeling-desired; validation; erotic-attention; intimacy-connection; modern-dating
18,Biochemical Reward System Dynamics,Framework & Model,"How motivation, bonding, and pleasure biology influences desire, attachment, and sexual satisfaction over time.","This report lens often includes dopamine-linked anticipation, bonding chemistry (commonly discussed via oxytocin), and comfort/pleasure pathways (endorphins). It’s useful for explaining why novelty can feel exciting, why safety can increase desire, and why chronic stress can blunt pleasure—without reducing relationships to “just chemicals.”",Desire spikes with anticipation and flirting; Connection increases after affectionate touch and aftercare; Chronic stress lowers libido even with attraction present.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Desire is only biology; Reward dynamics excuse harmful behavior; Novelty is required for long-term love; If chemistry changes, the relationship is doomed.",Dopamine; Oxytocin; Endorphins; Cortisol; Novelty; Reward System Recalibration,biochemical-reward; sexual-neurochemistry; libido-science; bonding; pleasure-system; stress-effects
19,Casual Dating,Identity & Orientation,"Dating with low or no commitment expectations, often focused on getting to know people before deciding on exclusivity.","Casual dating varies by region and community: in some places it implies non-exclusivity by default; in others, people assume early exclusivity. Good practice is explicit communication about expectations, safer-sex, and time/attention boundaries so nobody is surprised.",Seeing multiple people early on; Going on dates without exclusivity; Keeping things light while exploring compatibility.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,"Casual dating means no respect or care; Casual dating is always non-exclusive everywhere; Casual dating removes the need for honesty; If it’s casual, people don’t get hurt.",Silent (Assumed) Monogamy; Situationship; Consent Frameworks; Boundaries,casual-dating; dating-stage; nonexclusive-dating; relationship-clarity; global-dating-norms
20,Committed Partnership (Non-Exclusive),Identity & Orientation,A committed relationship where partners maintain emotional partnership while agreeing they are not sexually exclusive.,"This can include different ENM styles (open, polyamory, DADT) but emphasizes commitment as the anchor. The key is making agreements explicit: what counts as outside intimacy, disclosure rules, safer-sex, and how partners protect emotional security.","Committed couple with negotiated outside sex; Partners define “primary commitment” while allowing other connections; Clear rules about time, privacy, and health.",Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,"Non-exclusivity means no commitment; Commitment makes consent automatic; Outside sex fixes all relationship problems; If you’re committed, boundaries don’t matter.",Open Relationship; Polyamory; Relationship Form Preference; Boundaries; Consent Frameworks,nonexclusive-commitment; committed-open; ethical-nonmonogamy; relationship-agreements; primary-partnership
21,Communication Style,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing how someone naturally communicates needs, boundaries, and intimacy preferences (direct, expressive, reflective, analytical, reserved, persuasive).","Communication style influences consent clarity, conflict repair, and initiation success. Styles are shaped by culture and family norms; none are inherently better. Geo-ready reporting should offer “translation bridges” between styles (e.g., how a reserved person can still give clear consent, how a direct person can soften tone).",One partner prefers clear verbal asks; Another communicates through tone and mood; A couple uses simple check-in phrases to reduce misreads.,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,"If your style differs, you’re incompatible; Directness is rude; Reserved means hiding; Persuasive communication is always manipulation.",Initiation & Communication Style; Signal Mismatch; Consent Frameworks; Reflective Prompts,communication-style; intimacy-talk; consent-language; couples-communication; cross-cultural
22,Conditional Desire,Pattern & Dynamic,"A desire pattern where interest in sex depends strongly on specific conditions (safety, privacy, time, mood, health, emotional connection) rather than appearing “spontaneously.”","Conditional desire is often misread as rejection when it’s actually context-dependent arousal. It’s especially common when stress is high or privacy is limited. Reports should translate conditions into practical plans (timing, rituals, decompression) and reinforce that consent is easier when conditions are respected—not negotiated through pressure.",Desire appears on weekends but not weekdays; Needs repair conversation before intimacy; Requires privacy and enough time; Needs decompression after work first.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Conditional desire is an excuse; If desire is real, it should happen anytime; Conditions mean low attraction; You should push past conditions to “unlock” desire.",State Optimization; Energy Level; Conditional Initiation; Being Safe; Arousal Curve,conditional-desire; responsive-desire; libido-context; intimacy-conditions; stress-and-libido; relationship-planning
23,Conditional Initiation,Pattern & Dynamic,"An initiation subtype where someone initiates only when specific conditions are met (privacy, time, mood, cleanliness, safety, low stress).","Conditional initiation is often about state optimization, not attraction. In many regions, privacy constraints (shared housing, family proximity) strongly shape conditions. The healthiest approach is naming the conditions without blame and co-planning environments that support consent and comfort.",Initiates only when the door is locked and time is available; Needs decompression after work before starting; Prefers planned intimacy windows on weekends.,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,"Conditional means rejection; If conditions matter, desire is fake; Conditions are excuses; You should push past conditions to be spontaneous.",State Optimization; Energy Level; Privacy Constraints; Arousal Brake,conditional-initiation; timing; privacy; stress-and-libido; relationship-planning; global-lifestyle
24,Constellation of Archetypes,Framework & Model,A multi-archetype view showing that a person’s sexuality is often best described by a blend of patterns rather than a single label.,"A constellation approach supports nuance: people may be a “Sensual Connector” in long-term relationships but show “Explorer” traits in fantasy, or shift across life stages. This is especially geo-friendly because it avoids rigid identity claims and allows culturally shaped expression of the same core needs.",Top 3 archetypes shown with probabilities; A user identifies with two archetypes depending on context; A report highlights “secondary archetype” to guide next steps.,Product & Assessment,Sensitive,A constellation means the assessment is confused; You must pick only one true archetype; Multiple archetypes mean commitment problems; The blend is permanent and cannot evolve.,Archetype Probability Distributions (Full Signature); Core Archetype; Interpretive Depth; Longitudinal Deltas,constellation; multi-archetype; blended-profile; nuanced-results; culture-aware
25,Context-Sensitive Fantasies,Framework & Model,"Fantasies that change with mood, stress, relationship safety, culture, or life stage—showing that fantasy content is often context-driven rather than fixed.","Context-sensitive fantasies can intensify during stress, shift with novelty, or soften when safety and closeness increase. This concept helps users avoid over-identifying with any single fantasy and supports healthier disclosure (“this is a mood-fantasy, not a request”).","More intense fantasies during stress; Softer, bonding fantasies after repair; Fantasies shift when privacy or novelty changes.","Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Sensitive,"If your fantasies change, something is wrong; A fantasy is always a request; Context-sensitive means fantasies are meaningless; Fantasies should be acted out to be “real.”",Fantasy Pull; Fantasy–Reality Congruence; Stress And Desire; Emotional Safety,context-sensitive-fantasies; mood-fantasies; fantasy-variation; life-stage; global-context
26,Core Insecurities,Trait & Disposition,"Deep fears about adequacy, desirability, or safety that shape how someone approaches closeness, sex, and conflict.","Core insecurities often drive patterns like reassurance-seeking, avoidance, jealousy, or performance pressure. They’re common and changeable, especially with emotional safety, clear agreements, and non-shaming communication. In reports, the goal is self-awareness and healthier requests—not blame.",Avoiding initiation due to fear of rejection; Needing frequent reassurance to feel relaxed; Getting defensive when receiving feedback about sex.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,"Insecurity means you’re not ready for a relationship; Insecurities are fixed traits; If you feel insecure, your partner is at fault; Insecurities should be hidden to stay attractive.",Abandonment Insecurity; Engulfment Insecurity; Inadequacy / Performance Insecurity; Trust and Safety Insecurity,core-insecurities; relationship-anxiety; reassurance; jealousy; sexual-confidence
27,Core Motivation,Framework & Model,"A report dimension that summarizes the main reasons someone seeks intimacy (e.g., bonding, validation, novelty, stress relief, pleasure, meaning).","Core Motivation helps explain “what sex is for” in a person’s emotional system, which can differ across cultures, life stages, and relationship structures. Differences in motivation are common friction points: one partner may want reassurance while the other wants play or release. Best practice is to translate motivation into consent-friendly requests and shared rituals.",One partner wants closeness and reassurance; Another wants novelty and excitement; A couple finds their shared motivation is relaxation and reconnection after stress.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"There is only one healthy motivation; Motivation equals entitlement; If motivations differ, the relationship won’t work; Motivation is fixed forever.",Motivation for Sexuality; Importance of Sexuality; State-Based Reward; Event-Based Reward; Reflective Prompts,core-motivation; why-we-have-sex; intimacy-drivers; compatibility-insights; global-relationships
28,Cortisol,Data & Research Method,"A stress hormone that rises during chronic pressure and can reduce sexual desire, arousal, and pleasure by activating the body’s “survival mode.”","Cortisol is a useful report concept because it connects libido changes to life context (workload, sleep, conflict, uncertainty). Lowering chronic stress, improving recovery, and increasing safety cues often reduces inhibition and supports desire—without forcing outcomes.",Desire drops during burnout; Arousal is easier on vacation than during deadlines; Conflict increases stress and reduces sexual responsiveness.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Cortisol means your relationship is broken; Stress is an excuse; If you love someone, stress won’t matter; Cortisol explains all sexual problems.",Stress And Desire; Energy Level; Arousal Brake; State Optimization,cortisol; stress-hormone; libido-and-stress; burnout; arousal-brakes
29,Curiosity Level,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing openness to learning, novelty, and exploration in sexuality and relationships, including comfort with trying new ideas at a chosen pace.","Curiosity level isn’t a moral score. High curiosity can drive growth and play; lower curiosity can reflect preference for predictability, cultural values, or safety needs. Best matches come from negotiated pacing, consent clarity, and respect—not persuasion.","Enjoys experimenting with new touch styles; Prefers familiar routines with small tweaks; Likes learning through reading, courses, or guided prompts.","Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Sensitive,High curiosity means boundary-crossing; Low curiosity means boring; Curiosity should override consent; Curiosity predicts compatibility perfectly.,High Curiosity Orientation; Learning- and Mastery-Driven Curiosity; Progressive Precision; Consent Frameworks,curiosity-level; sexual-exploration; novelty; learning; consent-first; global-relationships
30,Desire Shutdown,Pattern & Dynamic,"A strong reduction or “switch-off” in desire and arousal, often triggered by stress, pressure, conflict, fear, shame, or lack of safety.","Shutdown is often a protective nervous-system response, not a moral choice. It can be temporary (a stressful season) or persistent (chronic conflict, unresolved pain, coercive dynamics). Reports should emphasize non-harm principles, consent, and repair; if coercion, trauma symptoms, or pain are present, qualified support is more important than optimization tips.","Desire disappears when conflict is unresolved; Pressure to perform leads to numbness; After betrayal, arousal is hard to access; Chronic stress keeps the body in “survival mode.”",Consent & Boundaries,Highly Sensitive,"Shutdown means you’re not sexual; Shutdown proves the relationship is over; The solution is to push harder; If you’re in a relationship, you should comply anyway.",Arousal Breaks; Cortisol; Emotional Safety; Repairing / Reconnecting; Non-Harm Principles,desire-shutdown; libido-shutdown; sexual-numbness; stress-response; consent-first; relationship-repair
31,Direct & Assertive,Trait & Disposition,"A communication style marked by clear, explicit language about desires, boundaries, and preferences, often preferring “say it plainly” consent and initiation.","This style can reduce ambiguity and help prevent signal mismatch, especially across cultures. The growth edge is warmth: directness works best with empathy and non-pressure language.","“Do you want to have sex tonight?”; “Slower, please.”; “I’m a no today, but I want cuddling.”",Sexual Communication & Initiation,General,Direct means aggressive; Direct people don’t need emotional context; Directness ruins romance; Directness equals entitlement.,Communication Style; Consent Frameworks; Signal Mismatch,direct-assertive; clear-communication; explicit-consent; boundary-language; relationship-skills
32,Disorganized Attachment,Trait & Disposition,"A report pattern where closeness and safety signals feel inconsistent, leading to mixed approach–avoid behaviors under stress.","This pattern can be linked to confusing relational learning histories and may show up as sudden shifts in desire, trust, or communication. Reports should be especially careful: non-shaming language, strong consent framing, and encouragement to seek qualified support if distress is high.",Inconsistent responses to intimacy; Alternating pursuit and withdrawal; Feeling both drawn to and overwhelmed by closeness.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Highly Sensitive,Disorganized means someone is dangerous; This pattern can’t change; It’s only caused by trauma; The label replaces professional support when needed.,Relational Loops; Emotional Safety; Somatic Integration; Non-Harm Principles,disorganized-attachment; mixed-signals; approach-avoid; relationship-stress; support
33,Don’t-Ask-Don’t-Tell (DADT),Identity & Orientation,An open-relationship style where outside connections are permitted but details are intentionally not shared between primary partners.,"DADT can reduce triggers for some people, but it can also create ambiguity if “privacy” becomes “secrecy.” It works best with clear rules: what must be disclosed (health/safety), what stays private, and how consent is maintained. In geo-diverse contexts, DADT sometimes overlaps with discretion needs; the key is that both partners freely agree.",Partners allow outside sex but don’t share details; Disclosure only for safer-sex updates; A couple avoids specifics to protect emotional stability.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,DADT is automatically dishonest; DADT means anything goes; DADT eliminates jealousy; DADT is the same as cheating.,Open Relationship; Boundaries; Consent Frameworks; Safer-Sex Agreements; Trust and Safety Insecurity,dadt; dont-ask-dont-tell; privacy-agreements; open-relationship-rules; discretion; consent-based
34,Dopamine,Data & Research Method,"A neurotransmitter strongly linked to motivation, anticipation, novelty, and “wanting,” which can influence sexual desire and pursuit.","Dopamine often drives pursuit energy (flirting, chasing novelty, anticipation) more than long-term contentment. In reports, it’s best framed as one ingredient: context, safety, and values still shape choices. Overstimulating novelty (including digital novelty) can make slower rewards feel less compelling for some people.",Feeling excited by anticipation before a date; Desire rises with novelty or playful uncertainty; Motivation drops when life feels monotonous or depleted.,Desire & Arousal,General,Dopamine equals love; High dopamine means better relationships; Dopamine explains everything about libido; You can “hack” dopamine to control partners.,Biochemical Reward System Dynamics; Novelty; Event-Based Reward; Reward System Recalibration,dopamine; motivation; anticipation; novelty-seeking; desire-drivers; reward-system
35,Embodied Confidence,Trait & Disposition,"A report pattern where sexual confidence comes from body awareness, comfort with sensation, and ability to pace and communicate in the moment.","Embodied confidence is supported by presence, somatic integration, and consent skills. It often looks like calm self-trust: adjusting touch, slowing down, and naming needs without shame. This can be culturally adaptable because it’s about internal cues, not explicit sexual language.",Comfortably asks for slower touch; Notices tension and pauses; Feels present rather than performing.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Embodied confidence means always wanting sex; Body awareness replaces verbal consent; If you’re embodied, you’ll never feel anxious; Embodied confidence is only for certain “types” of people.",Somatic Integration; Presence vs Performance; Consent Frameworks; Sexual Confidence,embodied-confidence; somatic-safety; self-trust; pleasure-skills; consent-aware
36,Embodiment Style,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing how a person connects to their body in intimacy (sensation-led vs mind-led, soft vs intense, grounded vs dissociated).","Embodiment style shapes pacing, arousal curves, and what helps presence. It can shift with stress, trauma history, body image, health, and relationship safety. Reports should be trauma-aware and non-shaming: the goal is more choice and comfort, not forcing a “right” embodiment.",Feels most present with slow touch and breath; Gets stuck in thoughts and loses sensation; Needs strong sensory input to feel grounded; Benefits from pausing to notice body cues.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Embodiment is fixed; If you’re not embodied, you’re broken; Body awareness replaces verbal consent; Embodiment skills can replace medical care for pain.",Embodied Integration; Attentional Focus; Presence vs Performance; Autonomic Nervous System,embodiment-style; body-awareness; somatic-intimacy; sexual-presence; nervous-system; global-wellbeing
37,Emotion-First Arousal,Pattern & Dynamic,"An arousal pattern where emotional connection, safety, and relational meaning typically spark desire before (or more than) physical stimulation does.","Emotion-first arousal is common across cultures and relationship stages, especially when trust, warmth, and “feeling chosen” are key safety cues. It doesn’t mean someone is “not sexual”—it means emotional attunement is the main accelerator and stress, conflict, or disconnection can be strong brakes. Helpful support includes repair, reassurance, and slow pacing with explicit consent.",Desire rises after a vulnerable conversation; Arousal increases following reassurance or repair; Touch feels best once emotional safety is restored.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Emotion-first means low libido; If you need emotion, attraction is missing; Emotional arousal makes consent automatic; This pattern can’t change across life stages.",Mind-Led Arousal; Subjective; Repairing / Reconnecting; Emotional Safety; Arousal Style,emotion-first-arousal; emotional-connection; intimacy-safety; desire-triggers; global-relationships
38,Endorphins,Data & Research Method,"Body-produced opioid-like chemicals linked to pleasure, comfort, stress relief, and pain reduction, often contributing to post-intimacy relaxation.","Endorphins can support the “soothing” side of sex and intimacy, especially when touch is safe and consensual. They also help explain why some people use sex for stress relief—and why stress can change what feels rewarding.",Increased relaxation after orgasm or cuddling; Feeling calm and comforted after affectionate touch; Pleasure feels more “soothing” than “thrilling.”,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Endorphins mean sex is a drug; Endorphins guarantee satisfaction; If you don’t feel relaxed, you did it wrong; Endorphins remove the need for aftercare.",Biochemical Reward System Dynamics; State-Based Reward; Aftercare; Stress And Desire,endorphins; pleasure-chemistry; relaxation; comfort; post-sex-afterglow
39,Energy Level,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing how much physical and emotional bandwidth someone typically has for intimacy, affecting timing, pacing, and frequency preferences.","Energy level is often misread as attraction. Reporting should connect energy to sleep, stress, health, and workload, and suggest practical adjustments (timing, shorter sessions, transition rituals). This is highly geo-relevant because living arrangements and privacy differ across regions.",Desire higher on weekends; Fatigue reduces arousal after late work; Prefers earlier evenings and calm transitions.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,Low energy means rejection; High energy means constant libido; Energy problems are solved by pushing through; Energy is purely personality and not health-related.,State Optimization; Stress And Desire; Sexual Frequency Expectations,energy-level; fatigue; timing; libido-context; wellbeing
40,Engulfment Insecurity,Trait & Disposition,"A fear of losing autonomy, identity, or space in a relationship, often leading to withdrawal when closeness feels too intense.","Engulfment insecurity can show up as needing decompression time, avoiding heavy talks during initiation, or feeling pressured by expectations. Healthy support includes respecting space, using low-pressure invitations, and building trust that autonomy and connection can coexist.",Needing time alone after conflict; Feeling turned off when sex feels demanded; Pulling back when a partner escalates intensity quickly.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Highly Sensitive,"Engulfment insecurity means low love; Wanting space is selfish; The solution is to push for closeness; If someone withdraws, consent is irrelevant.",Core Insecurities; Avoidant Attachment; Quiet Withdrawer; Boundaries,engulfment-fear; autonomy-needs; avoidant-pattern; pressure-response; space-and-connection
41,Erotic Meaning System,Framework & Model,"The personal “meaning map” that makes certain themes erotic (e.g., devotion, power, novelty, being seen, being safe), shaping desire and satisfaction.","Meaning systems are culturally and personally shaped: what feels erotic in one community may feel neutral or taboo in another. Reports should treat this as identity-adjacent but flexible—people can expand meaning over time. The practical use is translating meaning into consent-friendly requests and compatible rituals, not insisting on one script.","Finding devotion erotic (rituals, commitment); Feeling turned on by being admired; Power dynamics feel meaningful and arousing; Safety and tenderness are the core erotic driver.",Identity & Attraction,Sensitive,"Your meaning system is fixed forever; Meaning equals morality; If meanings differ, you’re incompatible; Meaning replaces consent and boundaries.",Being Seen; Being Safe; Being Chosen; Power Orientation; Spiritual Sexuality,erotic-meaning; desire-meaning; erotic-map; turn-on-themes; relationship-compatibility; cross-cultural
42,Evolving / Transcending,State & Experience,"A stage where intimacy expands into deeper meaning—through growth, spirituality, creativity, devotion, or a mature sense of erotic identity.","This stage can include spiritual sexuality, expanded intimacy scripts, and deeper emotional attunement. It should be described without superiority claims: not everyone wants transcendence, and cultural/religious expressions differ widely. Consent, humility, and non-harm principles remain central.",Partners create a meaningful ritual for intimacy; Sexuality becomes more about presence and bonding than outcomes; A person integrates desire with values and long-term purpose.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Transcending is better than “normal sex”; Spiritual framing replaces consent; This stage requires a specific religion; If you’re not transcending, you’re immature.",Spiritual Sexuality; Practical Wisdom Traditions; Optimal Sexual States; State-Based Reward; Sexual Self-Actualization,evolving; transcending; meaning-based-intimacy; spiritual-sexuality; mature-love
43,Exhibitionism,Identity & Orientation,"An erotic interest in being seen, watched, or desired—ethical when it’s consensual and privacy-safe (often expressed privately rather than publicly).","Consensual exhibitionism can include compliments, mirrors, outfits, role play, or agreed sharing between partners. Reports should emphasize consent and digital privacy: no sharing images without explicit permission, and consider local cultural/legal risks. Many people prefer “private exhibitionism” within a relationship.",Enjoying being watched by a consenting partner; Using mirrors or lighting to feel seen; Sharing consensual photos within agreed privacy rules.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,Exhibitionism means violating others’ boundaries; Wanting to be seen equals cheating; Being admired cancels consent; Exhibitionism must be public to be real.,Voyeurism; Sexting; Exhibitionist Performer; Consent Frameworks,exhibitionism; being-seen; praise; erotic-display; private-play; digital-safety
44,Expanding / Experimenting,State & Experience,"A stage where someone actively broadens their intimacy range—trying new activities, dynamics, or communication skills with consent and aftercare.","Experimenting works best when it’s paced, optional, and clearly negotiated. For geo-ready guidance, offer multiple “intensity levels” and emphasize privacy, consent, and cultural fit. This stage can include non-sexual experiments too (rituals, communication, play).",Trying a new touch style and debriefing what worked; Testing a playful role dynamic with a safe word; Adding novelty through dates and anticipation rather than explicit acts.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Sensitive,"Experimenting means doing extreme things; If one experiment fails, you should stop trying; Experimenting is unsafe in committed relationships; Consent is implied once you “agree to experiment.”",Roleplay Boundaries; Aftercare; Consent; Targeted Boosts; Presence vs Performance,expanding; experimenting; intimacy-experiments; sexual-growth; negotiated-play
45,Expressive & Performative,Trait & Disposition,"A communication style that uses emotion, storytelling, flirtation, and energetic expression to convey desire, interest, or boundaries.","This style can feel romantic and motivating, and it often thrives on praise, tone, and atmosphere. The risk is ambiguity: performance can be misread as consent or pressure unless paired with explicit check-ins. Privacy and cultural norms may shape how openly expression is shown.",Flirtatious teasing to initiate; Compliments and playful banter; Using tone and vibe rather than literal wording unless needed.,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,"Expressive equals manipulative; If it’s playful, consent is automatic; Expressive people are always high libido; Expressive styles don’t need boundaries.",Communication Style; Playful Seducer; Signal Mismatch; Consent Frameworks,expressive-communication; flirtation; emotional-expression; initiation-style; erotic-play
46,Fantasy Pull,Metric & Measurement,A report signal describing how strongly fantasies and imagination trigger arousal and desire for a person.,"Fantasy pull can be high or low and may change with stress, privacy, novelty, and life stage. High fantasy pull does not mean someone wants to act everything out; it often means mental imagery is a key accelerator. Reports should normalize private fantasy and reinforce the fantasy–practice distinction.",Fantasies reliably spark desire even when tired; Imagination boosts arousal before touch; Fantasy use increases during low-privacy periods when action is harder.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Fantasy pull means you’re dissatisfied with your partner; Fantasies reveal real intentions; High fantasy pull requires acting out fantasies; Fantasy pull replaces consent in real life.,Mind-Led Arousal; Fantasy–Reality Congruence; Ethical Containment; Typical Sexual Fantasies,fantasy-pull; imagination; desire-accelerator; erotic-fantasy; global-privacy
47,Fantasy–Reality Congruence,Metric & Measurement,The degree to which a person’s fantasies align with what they actually want (and is ethical) to do in real life.,"Low congruence is normal: many fantasies are symbolic, taboo, or narrative-driven without being desired in practice. High congrruence can support exploration when consent, safety, and boundaries are clear. Reports should avoid shame and clearly separate arousal (fantasy) from intention (practice).",Enjoying a fantasy theme but not wanting to enact it; Wanting to try a mild version of a fantasy with clear limits; Keeping certain fantasies private and imagination-only.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Congruence must be high to be healthy; Fantasies always reveal true desires; If congruence is high, consent is assumed; Low congruence means you’re lying.",Fantasy Pull; Ethical Containment; Fantasy vs Practice Distinction; Consent Frameworks,fantasy-reality-congruence; fantasy-vs-practice; consent; kink-education; shame-reduction
48,Five Love Languages,Framework & Model,"A specific, widely known model that groups affection into five categories: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch.","This framework is popular for couples because it’s memorable and practical, but it can oversimplify if treated as fixed identity labels. Strong reporting frames it as a communication tool: experiment, ask, and adapt—especially across cultures where touch, gifts, and service have different meanings.",Partners compare their top two love languages; A couple uses the model to plan date nights and daily affection; Someone discovers “acts of service” matter more than gifts.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,"The five love languages are a validated diagnostic test; You only have one love language; If partners differ, they’re incompatible; The model should replace real conversation about needs.",Love Language; Communication Style; Relationship Satisfaction; Typical Beliefs,five-love-languages; chapman; affection-model; couples-tool; relationship-skills; cross-cultural
49,Friends with Benefits,Identity & Orientation,"A connection that combines friendship with sex, typically without a traditional committed romantic relationship.","FWB works best with clarity about expectations (exclusivity, emotional involvement, communication, and what happens if feelings change).

Consent and aftercare still matter, even when the relationship is casual.",Two friends agree to have sex while staying non-exclusive; Agreement to keep dating others; Clear check-ins to prevent ambiguity.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,"FWB means no feelings are allowed; FWB is always emotionally unsafe; FWB equals using someone; If it’s casual, consent and aftercare don’t matter.",Casual Dating; Hook-Up / Non-Relational Sex; Situationship; Boundaries,friends-with-benefits; fwb; casual-sex; dating-agreements; expectations; modern-dating
50,Genital,Signal & Cue,"Genital (physiological) arousal signals such as erection, lubrication, swelling, sensitivity, and changes in genital blood flow.","Genital signals are bodily responses that can be influenced by friction, hormones, nervous-system state, and context. They may not match subjective desire, so reports should avoid using genital cues as proof of consent. In many cultures, discussing genital response may be sensitive—use respectful, medically neutral language.",Erection without desire; Lubrication increases during foreplay; Genital sensitivity changes with stress or medication.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Genital response equals consent; If genital response is slow, attraction is missing; Genital response proves sexual orientation; Genital signals are fully controllable by willpower.",Subjective; Arousal Non-Concordance; Autonomic Nervous System; Cortisol,genital-arousal; physiological-response; erection; lubrication; consent-first; sexual-health
51,Grounded / Integrated,State & Experience,"A stage where sexuality feels steady, values-aligned, and sustainable—supported by clear communication, consent, and predictable conditions for connection.","“Grounded” doesn’t mean boring; it means the relationship has a reliable intimacy rhythm and both partners feel safe to express needs and boundaries. Recommendations often focus on maintenance habits: check-ins, repair, and small novelty that fits the couple’s culture and lifestyle.",A couple has a shared initiation routine that feels natural; Partners can say no without conflict and reconnect easily; Desire stays stable through planning and stress management.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,"Integrated means you’ll always want sex; Grounded equals low passion; If you’re grounded, you don’t need check-ins; Integration is only possible in “perfect” relationships.",Longitudinal Check-ins; Cognitive Consonance; Hardware–Software Consonance; State-Based Reward; Relationship Satisfaction,grounded; integrated; sustainable-intimacy; relationship-rhythm; consent-aware
52,Growth Potentials,Framework & Model,"Report language for the most promising areas where small changes can meaningfully improve intimacy, communication, and satisfaction.","Growth potentials highlight leverage points (e.g., reduce pressure, add privacy, improve initiation clarity) rather than framing people as broken. This is most effective when paired with structured action → integration, realistic pacing, and culturally appropriate options (private, low-intensity steps). Clear, non-shaming language supports global usability.",“Add a weekly check-in”; “Create a decompression ritual before initiation”; “Practice a simple consent phrase”; “Shift from outcome goals to process pleasure.”,Product & Assessment,General,Growth means something is wrong with you; Growth requires big dramatic change; Growth potential guarantees results; Growth replaces consent and communication.,Structured Action → Integration Sequence; Reflective Prompts; Longitudinal Check-ins; State Optimization,growth-potentials; relationship-growth; intimacy-improvement; actionable-insights; couples-tools; global-compatibility
53,High Curiosity Orientation,Trait & Disposition,"A curiosity subtype where a person is energized by exploration, variety, and learning new dynamics, ideally within clear consent and safety guardrails.","High curiosity often pairs with novelty preference and experimentation, but it can be practiced gently and privately. Reports should offer “intensity ladders” (mild → moderate → advanced) so users can explore in culturally appropriate and consent-centered ways.",Enjoys trying new scenarios or role ideas; Seeks new knowledge and tools; Likes debriefing and iterating after experiments.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Sensitive,High curiosity equals recklessness; High curiosity means dissatisfaction with a partner; Curiosity requires extreme acts; Curiosity cancels boundaries.,Curiosity Level; Sensory Play; Ethical Constraints; Aftercare,high-curiosity; exploration-oriented; novelty-seeking; intimacy-experiments; kink-curiosity
54,High-Risk Orientation,Trait & Disposition,"A report sub-type indicating preference for higher novelty, faster escalation, and comfort with uncertainty—ideally with strong consent practices and safety planning.","High-risk orientation can be playful and exciting when paired with explicit consent and aftercare, but it can create friction with low-risk partners if pacing isn’t negotiated. Geo-ready reporting should emphasize ethical constraints and non-pressure language.",Enjoys spontaneous escalation; Likes intense novelty contexts; Benefits from clear safe words and debriefs during exploration.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Sensitive,High risk equals unsafe behavior; High risk justifies persistence after a no; High risk means commitment is impossible; High risk partners should “tone it down” for love.,Risk Orientation; Consent Frameworks; Aftercare; Curiosity & Exploration Orientation,high-risk; adventurous; fast-pacing; novelty-seeking; consent-safety
55,Hook-Up / Non-Relational Sex,Identity & Orientation,"Sex that is not intended to form a romantic relationship, often occurring as a one-time or occasional encounter.","Hookups can be ethical and positive when consent is clear, safer-sex is practiced, and expectations are aligned. Risk increases when alcohol, pressure, or vague “maybe” signals are involved. Geo-friendly language should avoid shame while emphasizing consent, safety, and privacy.",One-time consensual encounter; Occasional sex without dating; Meeting while traveling with clear expectations and safer-sex planning.,Consent & Boundaries,Highly Sensitive,"Hookups mean low self-worth; Consent is implied if people flirt; If it’s casual, safer-sex doesn’t matter; Hookups are always emotionally harmful.",Friends with Benefits; Consent Frameworks; Boundaries; Safer-Sex Agreements,hookup; casual-sex; nonrelational-sex; consent; safer-sex; nightlife
56,Importance of Sexuality,Trait & Disposition,A report dimension describing how central sexual connection is to someone’s relationship satisfaction and wellbeing.,"Importance is not the same as frequency or libido; it’s about priority. It can change with stress, health, parenting, aging, and cultural values. Reporting should avoid ranking (high isn’t “better”) and instead support negotiation: how to meet needs through sex, affection, reassurance, or alternative intimacy.",Sex feels like a key bonding channel; Sex matters but affection and teamwork matter more; Importance drops temporarily during burnout or illness.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,High importance means being shallow; Low importance means no love; Partners must match exactly; Importance equals sexual performance.,Sexual Frequency Expectations; Desire Discrepancy; State Optimization; Emotional Intimacy,importance-of-sex; intimacy-priority; relationship-satisfaction; libido-compatibility; life-stage
57,Inadequacy / Performance Insecurity,Trait & Disposition,"A fear of not being “good enough” sexually or relationally, often linked to self-monitoring, shame, or performance anxiety.","This insecurity can reduce desire by activating arousal brakes (overthinking, fear of judgment). It often improves through realistic expectations, state-based rewards, supportive feedback, and consent-centered pacing.",Over-focusing on orgasm or erection; Avoiding initiation due to fear of disappointing a partner; Feeling tense when receiving feedback about preferences.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Highly Sensitive,"Performance insecurity means you don’t want your partner; Confidence should be effortless; Trying harder fixes it; If you’re insecure, you should hide it from partners.",Core Insecurities; Performance Anxiety; Presence vs Performance; Validation,performance-insecurity; inadequacy; sexual-anxiety; self-consciousness; confidence-building
58,Indirect / Invitational Initiation,Pattern & Dynamic,"An initiation subtype where someone starts intimacy through cues (flirtation, closeness, touch hints) that invite a response rather than a direct verbal ask.","Indirect initiation can be culturally normal and can feel playful. The risk is signal mismatch, especially across cultures or neurodiversity differences. Reports should encourage “cue + check” (a playful cue paired with a simple consent check-in) to stay clear and respectful.",Leaning in for a kiss and pausing to check; Playful teasing that invites closeness; Touch-first initiation with a quick “is this okay?”,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,"Indirect initiation is always manipulative; If cues are given, consent is assumed; Indirect styles are childish; Indirect initiation means poor communication.",Initiation Style; Signal Mismatch; Consent Frameworks; Playful Seducer,indirect-initiation; flirting-cues; invitational; consent-checkin; cross-cultural-dating
59,Initiation Style,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing how someone typically starts intimacy (direct, indirect, responsive, conditional, or avoidant) and what initiation feels safe and appealing.","Initiation style is shaped by culture, privacy norms, gender scripts, and past experiences. Mismatches often create signal confusion (“I thought you weren’t interested”). Best practice is to co-design an initiation “protocol” that’s respectful, clear, and consent-centered—especially in multicultural relationships.",Prefers explicit verbal invites; Prefers touch-first cues with check-ins; Initiates only when privacy and time are guaranteed.,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,"If your styles differ, you’re incompatible; Indirect initiation is always manipulative; Direct initiation ruins romance; Initiation style proves experience level.",Active / Direct Initiation; Responsive Initiation; Indirect / Invitational Initiation; Signal Mismatch,initiation-style; starting-intimacy; consent-language; flirting; relationship-clarity; cross-cultural
60,Learning- and Mastery-Driven Curiosity,Trait & Disposition,"A curiosity subtype where exploration is motivated by skill-building—understanding bodies, communication, technique, and “getting better” through practice.","This subtype often prefers structured learning, feedback, and gradual progress. It pairs well with progressive precision and action → integration sequences. Reports should encourage presence so mastery doesn’t become performance pressure.",Enjoys learning anatomy and pleasure skills; Uses check-ins to improve communication; Tries one new practice at a time and integrates what works.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Mastery makes sex robotic; If you’re skilled, you never struggle; Learning should override partner preferences; Technique matters more than consent and connection.",Skill- and Knowledge-Based Confidence; Progressive Precision; Presence vs Performance; Reflective Prompts,mastery-driven-curiosity; skill-building; sex-education; pleasure-skills; relationship-learning
61,Libido Challenges,Pattern & Dynamic,"Ongoing difficulties with desire level, frequency alignment, or sustaining interest in sex, often influenced by stress, health, relationship context, or beliefs.","Libido challenges are common and rarely have one cause. Reports should normalize variability, avoid shame, and focus on actionable levers: energy, privacy, repair, communication, and medical support when relevant (pain, hormonal issues, medication side effects). For geo-ready guidance, consider living arrangements and cultural tabooization that limit privacy and conversation.",Desire drops during burnout or conflict; Partners mismatch on frequency expectations; Interest is present but arousal is hard to sustain; Desire returns on vacations/weekends.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,Low libido means low love; Libido issues are purely psychological; Libido can be fixed by willpower or pressure; Libido challenges mean the relationship is doomed.,Desire Discrepancy; Stress And Desire; Energy Level; Conditional Desire; Longitudinal Check-ins,libido-challenges; low-libido; desire-problems; sexual-frequency; relationship-stress; global-wellbeing
62,Living Apart Together (LAT),Identity & Orientation,A committed relationship where partners choose to live in separate homes while maintaining an ongoing partnership.,"LAT can be driven by work, parenting, finances, cultural expectations, or a preference for independence. It can support desire by preserving autonomy and novelty, but it also requires intentional rituals for connection and clear agreements about time, privacy, and commitment.",Partners maintain separate apartments; A couple chooses LAT to balance family responsibilities; Long-term partners live separately but plan regular intimacy time.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,LAT means low commitment; LAT is just dating; Living separately guarantees better sex; LAT removes the need for relationship agreements.,Relationship Form Preference; Autonomy Need; Loyal Ritualist; Sexual Stage,lat; living-apart-together; separate-homes; modern-commitment; relationship-structure; global-lifestyles
63,Love Language,Framework & Model,"A popular way to describe how people prefer to give and receive affection (e.g., words, time, touch, help, gifts).","Love language concepts can improve communication by turning vague needs into clear requests (“I need more touch” or “more quality time”). It’s not a clinical model and shouldn’t be used to stereotype or excuse unmet needs. Geo-friendly use means adapting examples to local norms (public affection, family roles, gift customs).",One partner feels loved through acts of service; Another needs regular verbal appreciation; A couple negotiates touch and time as primary affection channels.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,"Love languages are scientifically precise personality types; If you know love languages, conflict disappears; One love language is better than others; Love languages replace consent and boundaries.",Five Love Languages; Communication Style; Validation; Emotional Intimacy,love-language; affection-styles; relationship-communication; quality-time; physical-touch; global-culture
64,Low-Risk Orientation,Trait & Disposition,"A report sub-type indicating preference for predictability, gradual pacing, and clear agreements before trying new intimacy steps.","This style often thrives with structure, privacy, and explicit consent language.

65,Mind-Led Arousal,Pattern & Dynamic,"An arousal pattern where thoughts, imagination, anticipation, or fantasy typically activate desire before (or more than) physical touch does.","Mind-led arousal often responds strongly to narrative, novelty, teasing, and private mental space. It can be culturally shaped: in more conservative contexts, imagination may be a safer pathway than explicit action. Mind-led arousal is healthiest when paired with consent clarity—fantasy and desire cues should never pressure a partner.",Getting turned on by fantasy or role-play ideas; Desire spikes with anticipation texts before a date; Arousal builds through mental imagery even before touch.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Mind-led means you don’t like real sex; If you fantasize, you must enact it; Mind-led arousal is “just porn”; Mental arousal equals consent.",Fantasy Pull; Fantasy–Reality Congruence; Emotion-First Arousal; Consent Frameworks,mind-led-arousal; imagination; anticipation; fantasy-driven-desire; global-intimacy
66,Moderate-Risk Orientation,Trait & Disposition,"A report sub-type indicating comfort with some novelty and spontaneity while still valuing safety, consent, and clear limits.",This style often adapts well across life stages: playful experimentation with reliable repair and communication.

67,Monogamish,Identity & Orientation,"A mostly monogamous relationship with limited, negotiated exceptions (often occasional sex outside the relationship).","“Monogamish” arrangements vary widely by culture and couple: some allow rare exceptions, some allow experiences together, and some allow specific contexts (travel, events). It works best when boundaries are explicit, consent is ongoing, and secrecy is avoided. Many couples use it to balance commitment with novelty needs.",Occasional outside sex with clear rules; Threesomes with mutual consent; “Mostly exclusive” with pre-agreed exceptions.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,Monogamish is just cheating with a nicer name; It means the relationship is failing; It removes the need for boundaries; Everyone can handle it emotionally if they agree once.,Open Relationship; Consent Frameworks; Boundaries; Novelty; Jealousy Management,monogamish; mostly-monogamous; negotiated-exceptions; ethical-nonmonogamy; relationship-rules
68,Monogamy,Identity & Orientation,A relationship agreement where partners commit to sexual and/or romantic exclusivity with each other.,"Monogamy can mean different things in different countries, communities, and life stages: some couples define it as sexual exclusivity, others include emotional exclusivity, and some renegotiate boundaries over time. The healthiest version is explicit and consent-based—partners clearly define what “exclusive” means to them (online flirting, porn, emotional intimacy, etc.).",“Just us” sexually and romantically; Agreement to not date or sleep with others; Clear boundaries about flirting and intimacy with others.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,Monogamy means never feeling attraction to others; Monogamy is automatically the most ethical option; Monogamy guarantees sexual satisfaction; Monogamy means you never need consent conversations.,Relationship Form Preference; Boundaries; Consent Frameworks; Silent (Assumed) Monogamy,monogamy; exclusive-relationship; relationship-agreement; commitment; dating-norms; global-relationships
69,Novelty,Framework & Model,"A report signal describing how much newness, variety, and anticipation drive someone’s arousal and relationship excitement.","Novelty can be sexual (new activities) or contextual (new settings, dates, playful routines). High novelty preference doesn’t mean low commitment; it often means the reward system responds strongly to change and anticipation. Geo-friendly guidance includes “small novelty” options that fit privacy and cultural constraints.",New date nights reignite desire; Arousal increases on travel or in new contexts; A couple adds playful initiation rituals without changing relationship agreements.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Novelty means you can’t be monogamous; You must do extreme things; Novelty is disrespectful to tradition; If novelty fades, love is gone.",Event-Based Reward; Reward System Recalibration; Arousal Accelerator; State Optimization,novelty; variety; anticipation; spark; desire-drivers
70,Open Relationship,Identity & Orientation,A consensual agreement that allows partners to have sexual (and sometimes romantic) connections outside the primary relationship.,"Open relationships fall under ethical/consensual non-monogamy (ENM). The healthiest versions are explicit about scope (sex-only vs romantic), privacy, safer-sex practices, and how to handle feelings.

71,Orgasm,Framework & Model,"A report signal describing how important orgasm is to someone’s sense of sexual satisfaction, completion, and reward.","For some people orgasm is central; for others it’s optional or variable. Over-focusing on orgasm can increase performance pressure, while under-valuing it can ignore legitimate needs.

72,Outcome-Focused,Trait & Disposition,"A pleasure orientation where satisfaction depends strongly on results (orgasm, performance goals, “success markers,” intensity peaks).","Outcome focus can be motivating, but it often increases performance anxiety and reduces presence. Reports should offer balancing strategies: widen the definition of success, add process rewards, and use consent check-ins so goals never become pressure. This is especially important when stress or health changes make outcomes variable.",Sex feels incomplete without orgasm; Tracking performance milestones; Feeling disappointed despite connection if goals aren’t met.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Outcome focus is always selfish; If orgasm doesn’t happen, sex failed; Goals should override partner comfort; Outcome focus guarantees better sex.",Event-Based Reward; Performance Anxiety; Orgasm; Presence vs Performance,outcome-focused; orgasm-focus; performance-goals; sexual-satisfaction; anxiety; couples-communication
73,Oxytocin,Data & Research Method,"A hormone and neuropeptide associated with bonding, trust cues, and social connection, which can support closeness and post-intimacy warmth.","Oxytocin effects vary by context: it often amplifies existing social cues rather than guaranteeing trust. In intimacy reporting, it’s best described as a “bonding signal” that can increase feelings of closeness when the relationship context is safe and consensual.",Cuddling increases a sense of connection; Aftercare deepens emotional bonding; Gentle touch and reassurance support closeness before intimacy.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,General,"Oxytocin guarantees trust; Oxytocin means monogamy is natural; Oxytocin replaces communication and repair; If you don’t feel bonded, something is wrong with you.",Biochemical Reward System Dynamics; Endorphins; Emotional Intimacy; Aftercare,oxytocin; bonding; attachment-chemistry; closeness; aftercare; intimacy
74,Pacing & Arousal Curve,Framework & Model,"A report concept describing how speed, timing, and escalation shape arousal—how quickly it builds, peaks, and settles for a person or couple.","Pacing is a major compatibility factor: some people like a slow build, others prefer quick escalation. Differences can be negotiated by creating “pacing agreements” (slow/fast lanes) and using consent check-ins at key moments. Geo factors like privacy and time constraints strongly affect pacing.","One partner needs a long warm-up; A couple agrees on “slow start, then decide”; Arousal drops when rushed; Planning earlier in the evening improves pacing.",Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Pacing shouldn’t matter if attraction is real; Faster is always better; Slow pacing means low desire; Pacing agreements ruin spontaneity.,Arousal Curve; Spike-Based Arousal; Wave-Based Arousal; Consent Frameworks,pacing; arousal-curve; sexual-escalation; foreplay; intimacy-timing; global-lifestyles
75,Partner-Focused,Need & Preference,"A relational subtype where arousal and satisfaction increase when attention is on a partner’s cues, pleasure, and emotional experience.","Partner-focused orientation can support attunement and generosity, but it can also slide into people-pleasing if boundaries are weak.

76,Passive or Avoidant Initiation,Pattern & Dynamic,"An initiation subtype where someone rarely initiates and may withdraw when intimacy feels pressured, unsafe, or overwhelming.","This can be driven by low energy, anxiety, shame scripts, fear of rejection, trauma history, or relationship conflict.

If coercion or distress is present, non-harm principles and professional support are more important than “tips.”",Avoids initiating due to fear of rejection; Pulls back when a partner escalates quickly; Prefers affection without expectations.,Consent & Boundaries,Highly Sensitive,"Passive means no attraction; Avoidant initiation should be “fixed” by pushing; If someone doesn’t initiate, consent is implied when they don’t resist; Withdrawal is punishment.",Quiet Withdrawer; Arousal Brake; Repairing / Reconnecting; Non-Harm Principles,passive-initiation; avoidant-initiation; pressure-response; emotional-safety; consent-first
77,Performance-Based Confidence,Trait & Disposition,"A confidence pattern where feeling “good at sex” depends heavily on outcomes, evaluation, or hitting performance goals (orgasm, erection, technique).","This pattern can boost motivation but also increases performance anxiety and event-based reward pressure.

78,Polyamory,Identity & Orientation,"A consensual non-monogamy structure that allows multiple romantic relationships, with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved.","Polyamory emphasizes informed consent, honesty, and relationship agreements (time, emotional commitment, safer sex, boundaries).

79,Power Exchange,Pattern & Dynamic,A consensual dynamic where partners intentionally trade control and responsibility (dominant/submissive roles or negotiated leadership) for erotic or emotional effect.,"Power exchange is defined by consent, negotiation, and boundaries—often including safewords, aftercare, and debriefs. It can be playful and low-intensity or more structured.

80,Power Orientation,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing a person’s preferred power dynamic in intimacy (leading, yielding, switching, or egalitarian), expressed consensually.","Power orientation can show up in subtle ways (who initiates, who plans) or explicit erotic roles. It can be fluid across contexts and life stages. Reports should emphasize that power preferences are only healthy when explicit, voluntary, and reversible—and never used to override consent.",Prefers to lead with confident initiation; Prefers to surrender control to relax; Enjoys switching roles depending on mood and partner.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Power preference equals daily-life control issues; Power dynamics remove the need for consent; Wanting to lead means aggression; If partners differ, it’s unsafe to talk about.",Power Exchange; Erotic Polarity; Roleplay Boundaries; Consent Frameworks,power-orientation; dominance-submission; role-dynamics; consent-safety; erotic-compatibility
81,Power-Based Arousal,Pattern & Dynamic,"An arousal pattern where desire increases through consensual power dynamics (leading/following, control/surrender, authority/play).","Power-based arousal can be subtle (who initiates, who “guides” pacing) or explicit (BDSM-style roles). It is healthiest when negotiated, reversible, and supported by boundaries, safewords, and aftercare. Cultural norms may influence how openly power themes are discussed, so reports should offer private, low-intensity options too.",Arousal increases when one partner confidently leads; Desire rises with consensual dominance/submission play; A couple uses a “yes/no/maybe” list to explore power themes safely.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Power arousal equals wanting control in daily life; Power dynamics remove the need for consent; Enjoying power play means aggression; If partners differ, it’s unsafe to discuss.",Power Orientation; Power Exchange; Roleplay Boundaries; Aftercare,power-based-arousal; dominance-submission; erotic-polarity; consent-first; kink-safety
82,Process-Focused,Trait & Disposition,"A pleasure orientation where satisfaction comes mainly from the experience itself—connection, sensation, play, and closeness—rather than specific outcomes.","Process-focused people often benefit from state-based rewards and may feel turned off by pressure or scorekeeping. This orientation is highly geo-friendly because it supports intimacy even when privacy, time, or life stress limits “full sessions.” It pairs well with consent-centered pacing and aftercare.",Feeling satisfied from kissing and touch; Enjoying slow build without needing a specific end point; Valuing connection and aftercare as part of intimacy.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,Process focus means you don’t care about orgasm; Process focus is “low passion”; If you’re process-focused you can’t enjoy novelty; Process focus replaces communication about needs.,State-Based Reward; Presence vs Performance; Actual Pleasure; Aftercare,process-focused; process-over-outcome; intimacy-quality; connection; pleasure; sustainable-sex
83,Psychometric Approximation,Data & Research Method,"A measurement approach where report scores estimate complex traits from survey answers—useful, but never perfectly precise.","Psychometric approximations translate self-report into structured dimensions with known limits (noise, bias, context effects). Good reporting emphasizes “approximate and actionable,” includes reliability/validity notes, and avoids clinical-sounding certainty. This is especially important for geo-ready products where translation and cultural norms can shift item meaning.",A libido-related score changes after a stressful month; Two close archetypes appear because answers are mixed; A report flags low certainty when responses are inconsistent.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Approximation means the report is useless; Approximation equals guessing; Scores can be treated as diagnoses; Measurement error only happens when users lie.,Psychometric Scoring Layer; Validity; Reliability; Context-Sensitive Assessments; Interpretive Depth,psychometric-approximation; measurement-limits; survey-science; uncertainty; global-calibration
84,Recharging / Pausing,State & Experience,"A stage where someone intentionally slows down or pauses sexual activity to recover energy, reduce pressure, and restore safety or desire.","This stage can be healthy and strategic—especially during burnout, grief, postpartum, illness, or major life transitions. The goal is not avoidance; it’s restoring capacity and agency. Recommendations often focus on non-sexual intimacy, stress reduction, and low-pressure connection.",Choosing cuddling and affection without escalation; Taking a break from performance goals during a stressful month; Rebuilding sleep and privacy to support future desire.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,Pausing means the relationship is failing; Pausing equals rejection; Pausing should be indefinite; Pausing means someone is not sexual.,State Optimization; Stress And Desire; Aftercare; Non-Harm Principles; Longitudinal Check-ins,recharging; pausing; libido-recovery; stress-and-desire; low-pressure-intimacy
85,Reflective & Symbolic,Trait & Disposition,"A communication style that expresses desire and meaning through reflection, metaphor, values language, or “what this represents” emotionally.","This style often emphasizes purpose, intimacy meaning, and emotional truth more than explicit mechanics. It can be especially common in cultures where direct sex talk feels taboo, offering a respectful pathway to communicate needs indirectly—ideally with consent clarity added when decisions are required.","Discussing intimacy as “connection and devotion”; Using rituals or meaning-setting to initiate; Sharing feelings through letters, messages, or symbolic gestures.",Sexual Communication & Initiation,General,"Reflective means avoiding reality; Symbolic talk replaces consent; If someone uses metaphors, they’re not sexual; Reflection means low desire.",Spiritual Lover; Typical Beliefs; Practical Wisdom Traditions; Consent Frameworks,reflective-symbolic; meaning-based-intimacy; values-talk; ritual; culture-sensitive
86,Relational Orientation,Metric & Measurement,A report dimension describing whether desire and satisfaction are driven more by relational connection (we/us) or personal experience (me) during intimacy.,"Relational orientation helps explain common mismatches: one person seeks bonding and reassurance while the other seeks self-led pleasure or stress relief. Neither is wrong; the goal is translating orientation into compatible experiences (e.g., connection-first warm-up + self-focused release) with clear consent.",Caring most about feeling emotionally connected; Wanting intimacy to affirm commitment; Preferring shared rituals and mutual attention.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,Relational orientation means codependency; If you’re relational you don’t enjoy personal pleasure; Partners must match exactly; Relational orientation replaces consent.,Partner-Focused; Being Chosen; Being Safe; Emotional Intimacy,relational-orientation; connection-driven; bonding; couples-intimacy; relationship-needs; global-relationships
87,Relationship Anarchy,Identity & Orientation,"A relationship philosophy that rejects ranking relationships by default and instead builds agreements based on autonomy, consent, and personal values.","Relationship anarchy (RA) treats different bonds (romantic, sexual, friendship) as customizable rather than automatically hierarchical. RA does not mean “no commitment”—it means commitment is chosen and negotiated rather than assumed. Geo-friendly reporting should highlight that RA can be practiced privately and respectfully in cultures where social norms are stricter.",Not assuming romance is more important than friendship; Negotiating each relationship on its own terms; Avoiding default couple-privilege when values don’t support it.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,RA means avoiding responsibility; RA is the same as casual dating; RA means no boundaries; RA is anti-monogamy by definition.,Polyamory; Relationship Form Preference; Boundaries; Consent Frameworks; Autonomy Need,relationship-anarchy; relational-autonomy; nonhierarchical; relationship-values; negotiated-agreements; consent-first
88,Relationship Form Preference,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing preferred relationship structure (e.g., monogamy, consensual non-monogamy, flexible agreements) as a compatibility factor.","This dimension should be treated as values-and-consent driven, not moral. Geo-ready reporting should acknowledge that norms differ widely by region and community, while still emphasizing that agreements must be explicit and freely chosen. Mismatch here is often a guardrail issue, not a “work harder” issue.",Prefers monogamy with clear exclusivity; Prefers open relationships with negotiated rules; Chooses flexible agreements during long-distance periods.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,Non-monogamy means no commitment; Monogamy is always healthiest; Preference is fixed forever; Partners can ignore this mismatch if chemistry is strong.,Sexual Script; Boundaries; Consent Frameworks; Gates / Guardrails,relationship-form-preference; monogamy; nonmonogamy; relationship-agreements; compatibility
89,Repairing / Reconnecting,State & Experience,"A stage focused on rebuilding trust, closeness, and safety after conflict, distance, or a difficult intimacy experience.","Repairing often emphasizes emotional attunement, accountability, and gentle re-entry into touch with clear consent. In geo-diverse contexts, “repair” can be framed through values like respect, dignity, and care—without forcing explicit sexual talk if that feels culturally unsafe.","The couple uses a weekly check-in to reduce tension; Partners restart intimacy with slow, consented touch; After a misunderstanding, they use aftercare and reassurance to reconnect.",Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,"Repair means someone is at fault; Repair requires immediate sex to prove closeness; If you need repair, you’re incompatible; Repair can happen without boundaries or consent.",Aftercare; Consent Frameworks; Relational Loops; Emotional Safety; Feedback Loops,repairing; reconnecting; relationship-repair; emotional-safety; intimacy-rebuild
90,Reserved & Withdrawn,Trait & Disposition,"A communication style where someone shares less verbally, prefers privacy, and may pull back under pressure—often needing time and safety to speak openly.",This style can be culturally shaped (modesty norms) or nervous-system shaped (stress responses). It can be healthy when partners respect pacing and create low-pressure invitations. Reporting should emphasize that “reserved” still needs clear consent signals and boundaries—just expressed gently.,Short answers instead of long talks; Prefers nonverbal affection; Needs decompression time before discussing intimacy.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,Reserved means rejection; Withdrawn equals manipulation; You should push to “get answers”; Reserved people don’t need consent check-ins.,Quiet Withdrawer; Stress And Desire; Signal Mismatch; Consent Frameworks,reserved-withdrawn; privacy; slow-communication; pressure-response; reconnection
91,Responsive Initiation,Pattern & Dynamic,An initiation subtype where someone is more likely to engage after a partner initiates or after arousal begins through context/touch rather than starting it themselves.,"Responsive initiation is common and not a flaw. It can reflect responsive desire, low energy, cultural modesty norms, or preference for being invited. Healthy pairing includes clear invitations, permission to say no, and avoiding scorekeeping about “who initiates.”",More engaged once foreplay begins; Prefers being invited rather than starting; Enjoys initiating after feeling safe and warmed up.,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,"Responsive means low libido; Responsive partners are lazy; If you don’t initiate, you don’t care; Responsive initiation makes consent less important.",Initiation Style; Body-First Arousal; Desire Discrepancy; Consent Frameworks,responsive-initiation; responsive-desire; invitation; low-pressure; intimacy-pacing
92,Risk Orientation,Metric & Measurement,"A report dimension describing someone’s comfort with uncertainty and intensity in dating, intimacy pacing, and sexual exploration.","Risk orientation affects how fast people escalate, how they handle novelty, and how they interpret “maybe.” It is shaped by personality, culture, and past experiences. Reporting should normalize differences and focus on negotiated pacing, consent clarity, and safety cues.",One partner prefers slow steps; Another prefers spontaneity; A couple sets a shared pace and uses check-ins to reduce anxiety.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,Low risk means prudish; High risk means reckless; Risk orientation equals consent willingness; Partners must match exactly.,Low-Risk Orientation; Moderate-Risk Orientation; High-Risk Orientation; Consent Frameworks,risk-orientation; pacing; novelty-vs-safety; dating-style; relationship-negotiation
93,Role-Based Confidence,Trait & Disposition,"A confidence pattern where comfort and desire increase when roles are clear (leader/follower, initiator/receiver, caregiver/cherished), with consent and boundaries.","Roles can be cultural (who initiates) or erotic (power orientation). This can reduce uncertainty and increase arousal, but it becomes risky if roles become rigid or override consent. Reports should encourage flexibility and explicit agreements.",Feels relaxed when they lead initiation; Enjoys being guided with clear consent; Prefers predictable roles in long-term routines.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Role-based confidence equals sexism; Roles eliminate the need for consent; If roles shift, attraction dies; Wanting a role means wanting control in all areas.",Power Orientation; Erotic Polarity; Consent Frameworks; Loyal Ritualist,role-based-confidence; roles; polarity; initiation-roles; consent-boundaries
94,Scores & Benchmarks,Metric & Measurement,Numerical results in a report that summarize dimensions (scores) and compare them to reference ranges or typical patterns (benchmarks).,"Benchmarks are meant to add context, not judgment. They can be population-based (global/regional) or model-based (archetype prototypes). Because cultural norms affect how people answer sensitive questions, benchmarks should be explained clearly and used alongside uncertainty notes and personalized interpretation.",A “communication comfort” score with a typical range; A percentile showing how common a preference is in a region; A benchmark comparing a user to an archetype prototype profile.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Benchmarks define what is normal or correct; Higher scores are always better; Benchmarks apply equally across all cultures and languages; A single score captures the full truth.,Normalized Dimension Values; Dimension Weights; Interpretive Depth; Validity; Reliability,scores-and-benchmarks; assessment-scores; percentiles; reference-ranges; explainable-results
95,Secure Attachment,Trait & Disposition,"A report pattern indicating comfort with closeness and independence, with relatively stable trust and lower fear-driven reactivity in relationships.","Secure attachment in reports is a self-report pattern, not a diagnosis. It often predicts easier repair, clearer consent communication, and less escalation during conflict. Cultural norms influence how security is expressed (direct reassurance vs quiet reliability).",Can say no without panic; Handles conflict with repair; Feels connected without constant reassurance.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,General,Secure means no insecurities; Secure people never struggle sexually; Secure equals “best” and others are bad; Security means you don’t need boundaries.,Attachment Style; Relational Loops; Repairing / Reconnecting; Emotional Safety,secure-attachment; trust; stability; relationship-security; repair
96,Self-Focused,Need & Preference,"A relational subtype where arousal and satisfaction increase when attention is on one’s own sensations, internal state, fantasy, and pleasure experience.","Self-focused does not mean selfish; it often reflects embodied awareness or mind-led arousal. The key is communication and mutuality: partners can alternate focus, use clear invitations, and ensure consent remains central. This can be especially helpful for people managing stress or performance anxiety by staying with their own body cues.",Needs private mental space to stay turned on; Uses fantasy to build arousal; Prefers guiding a partner to match their sensation preferences.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,Self-focused means you don’t care about your partner; Self-focus is incompatible with commitment; Self-focus cancels consent; Self-focused people can’t do emotional intimacy.,Relational Orientation; Mind-Led Arousal; Embodiment Style; Attentional Focus,self-focused; self-led-pleasure; embodiment; fantasy; arousal-pattern; intimacy-communication
97,Serial Monogamy,Identity & Orientation,"A relationship pattern of having one exclusive partner at a time, moving through monogamous relationships sequentially.","Serial monogamy is common globally and can be values-aligned for people who prefer deep one-to-one bonds but don’t expect lifelong partnership with a single person. It’s not inherently “better” or “worse” than other forms; the key is honesty, repair, and clear closure between relationships to avoid overlap and ambiguity.",Exclusive relationships over time with different partners; Dating one person at a time but not for life; Clear breakups before starting a new committed relationship.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,Serial monogamy is the same as cheating; It means someone can’t commit; It guarantees emotional safety; It’s identical across all cultures and generations.,Monogamy; Casual Dating; Relationship Form Preference; Commitment Scripts,serial-monogamy; one-at-a-time; dating-patterns; commitment-style; relationship-lifecycle
98,Serotonin,Data & Research Method,"A neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, satisfaction, and emotional stability, which can influence sexual interest indirectly through wellbeing.","Serotonin is often discussed in relation to mood and stress balance; changes in serotonin systems (including via some medications) can affect desire, arousal, and orgasm for some people. Reports should keep it practical: mood, sleep, and stress management matter, and medical questions belong with clinicians.",Desire improves as mood stabilizes; Low mood reduces interest in intimacy; Some people notice sexual side effects when starting or changing medication.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Serotonin is a libido switch; More serotonin always increases desire; If libido changes, it’s only brain chemistry; Neurochemicals replace relationship context.",Cortisol; Stress And Desire; Biochemical Reward System Dynamics; Energy Level,serotonin; mood-and-libido; wellbeing; satisfaction; mental-health
99,Sexual Archetypes,Framework & Model,"A report framework that groups recurring desire, bonding, and intimacy patterns into recognizable “archetypes” to support self-understanding and communication.","Sexual archetypes are not diagnoses or fixed identities—they’re practical pattern labels that help people talk about what reliably increases connection, arousal, safety, and satisfaction. In geo-diverse contexts, archetypes should be interpreted with cultural humility: the same pattern may look different across regions, religions, and relationship norms. The best use is as a conversation starter plus actionable guidance (turn-ons, brakes, boundaries, and needs).",A user recognizes they’re motivated by emotional closeness more than novelty; A couple uses archetypes to discuss initiation and pacing; A report shows top 2 archetypes to reduce over-labeling.,Product & Assessment,Sensitive,Archetypes are permanent identities; One archetype is “better” or more evolved; Archetypes predict relationship success with certainty; Archetypes replace consent and communication.,Archetype Probability; Constellation of Archetypes; Core Archetype; Alignment Profiles; Interpretive Depth,sexual-archetypes; intimacy-archetypes; relationship-report; desire-patterns; global-compatibility
100,Sexual Stage,Framework & Model,"A report concept that describes where someone currently is in their intimacy journey (e.g., paused, repairing, exploring, integrating), based on context and readiness.","Sexual stages are meant to be temporary and compassionate—reflecting energy, safety, stress, and relationship context rather than “progress level.” Stages help tailor recommendations: someone in repair may need reconnection tools, while someone exploring may need consent frameworks and boundaries. Geo-friendly design avoids moral hierarchy and respects local values around privacy and sexuality.","A person in a high-stress season shows “Recharging / Pausing”; After conflict, a couple shows “Repairing / Reconnecting”; A user with stable routines shows “Grounded / Integrated.”",Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,A stage is a fixed label; Higher stages are superior; A stage determines compatibility; Stages replace communication and consent check-ins.,Recharging / Pausing; Repairing / Reconnecting; Awakening / Exploring; Grounded / Integrated; Longitudinal Deltas,sexual-stage; intimacy-stage; relationship-season; readiness; context-aware
101,Situationship,Pattern & Dynamic,"An ambiguous relationship that includes dating-like behavior without clear labels, commitments, or agreements.","Situationships often happen when people avoid clarity talks, have mismatched goals, or face external constraints (distance, family pressure, life transitions). They can be temporary and consensual, but they frequently create insecurity and mixed signals. A small step—defining expectations and boundaries—usually improves emotional safety.",Regular intimacy and texting without exclusivity talk; Acting like a couple but avoiding labels; One person wants commitment while the other avoids defining the relationship.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,"Situationships are always toxic; A label is required for consent; Ambiguity is romantic; If someone won’t define it, you should push harder.",Silent (Assumed) Monogamy; Casual Dating; Signal Mismatch; Core Insecurities,situationship; undefined-relationship; dating-ambiguity; mixed-signals; modern-relationships
102,Skill- and Knowledge-Based Confidence,Trait & Disposition,"A confidence pattern where sexual self-assurance comes from learning (anatomy, communication, consent skills) and applying knowledge with curiosity and care.","This pattern tends to improve with education and feedback and pairs well with progressive precision and structured action → integration. The growth edge is staying present: knowledge should support, not replace, embodied connection.",Learns turn-ons/turn-offs through discussion; Uses check-ins and aftercare; Gains confidence after improving sexual education literacy.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,Knowledge makes sex robotic; Skilled means you never struggle; Skill should override partner preferences; Learning kills spontaneity.,Guided Self-Understanding; Progressive Precision; Structured Action → Integration Sequence; Consent Frameworks,skill-based-confidence; sex-education; communication-skills; learning; sexual-self-efficacy
103,Soft-Sensory,Need & Preference,"An embodiment subtype where gentle sensation, warmth, and soothing touch are the most reliable pathway into pleasure and arousal.","Soft-sensory preference often overlaps with wave-based arousal and process-focused pleasure. It’s highly compatible with low-pressure intimacy rituals (massage, cuddling, slow kissing) and can be culturally adaptable because it doesn’t require explicit scripts or high intensity. Consent check-ins keep softness from becoming assumed escalation.","Prefers slow caresses over intense stimulation; Enjoys warmth, cuddling, and gentle pressure; Responds well to sensual massage with clear boundaries.",Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,Soft sensory means low libido; Gentle touch is “not real sex”; Softness implies consent for escalation; If you want soft touch you can’t enjoy intensity.,Sensual Massage; Sensory Play; Wave-Based Arousal; Process-Focused,soft-sensory; gentle-touch; soothing-pleasure; slow-sex; intimacy-rituals; couples-care
104,Spike-Based Arousal,Pattern & Dynamic,"An arousal pattern where desire rises quickly in sharp bursts (often triggered by novelty, thrill, or strong cues) and may drop quickly if conditions shift.","Spike-based arousal can be fun and energizing, but it can also be sensitive to stress interruptions, pressure, or loss of novelty. Sustainable support often includes managing expectations, creating “mini-anticipation” rituals, and balancing spikes with state-based rewards (connection and presence).","Sudden desire from flirting; Arousal drops if interrupted or rushed; Strong response to novelty or thrill; Benefits from quick, clear consent and timing.",Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Spikes mean you can’t do long-term intimacy; Spike arousal justifies impulsive behavior; If spikes fade, love is gone; Spike patterns mean low emotional depth.",Novelty; Event-Based Reward; Reward System Recalibration; Arousal Curve,spike-based-arousal; fast-arousal; novelty-driven; spark; desire-pattern; sustainable-intimacy
105,Strategic & Persuasive,Trait & Disposition,"A communication style that uses reasoning, negotiation, and influence to shape outcomes, often emphasizing arguments, framing, or “selling” ideas.","This can be positive in collaborative planning (e.g., proposing date night), but it can become unsafe if it turns into pressure around consent or boundaries. Geo-ready reporting should distinguish healthy persuasion (options + respect) from coercion (guilt, persistence after a no).",Proposing a plan with benefits and compromises; Negotiating frequency expectations respectfully; Unhealthy: continuing to argue after a boundary is stated.,Consent & Boundaries,Sensitive,"Persuasion is always manipulation; If someone is persuasive, consent is impossible; Being strategic means lying; Persuasion is required to keep a relationship alive.",Strategic Manipulator; Ethical Constraints; Consent Frameworks; Boundaries,strategic-persuasive; negotiation; influence; consent-safety; communication-style
106,Subjective,Signal & Cue,"The felt, mental-emotional experience of arousal (interest, desire, excitement, safety, and “I want this”), which may or may not match genital response.","Subjective arousal depends heavily on meaning, safety, relationship context, and mood. It’s often the most consent-relevant signal because it reflects willingness and comfort. Reports should encourage users to name subjective cues clearly (yes/maybe/no) and not to overinterpret silence or politeness.",Feeling turned on without strong genital response; Feeling “not into it” even if the body reacts; Desire rises after emotional connection and reassurance.,Consent & Boundaries,Sensitive,"Subjective arousal is “just thoughts” and doesn’t matter; If you feel desire, consent is guaranteed; Subjective arousal should be constant in a good relationship; Subjective arousal can be forced by logic.",Genital; Arousal Non-Concordance; Consent Frameworks; Emotional Safety,subjective-arousal; felt-desire; willingness; consent-signals; emotional-context; global-communication
107,Supportive & Adaptive,Trait & Disposition,"A communication style focused on reassurance, flexibility, and adjusting to a partner’s needs, often prioritizing harmony and emotional safety.","This style can be excellent for repair and consent-centered pacing, especially in high-stress seasons. The growth edge is self-advocacy: supportive communicators may need practice stating their own needs without over-accommodating.","In conflict, they validate feelings first; They ask “What would feel good for you?”; They change pace quickly when a partner signals discomfort.",Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,Supportive means no preferences; Adaptive means people-pleasing; Supportive partners should accept any request; Being supportive replaces explicit consent.,Repairing / Reconnecting; Emotional Safety; Boundaries; Reflective Prompts,supportive-communication; adaptive-style; reassurance; emotional-safety; couples-repair
108,Trust and Safety Insecurity,Trait & Disposition,"A fear that people aren’t reliable or safe, which can create hypervigilance, jealousy, and difficulty relaxing into intimacy.","This insecurity may come from past betrayal, inconsistent care, or cultural environments where trust feels risky. In reports, the emphasis should be on building safety cues: clear agreements, repair after ruptures, transparency aligned with privacy, and consent-first communication.",Suspicion when a partner is private with their phone; Difficulty relaxing during sex; Needing clear rules and follow-through to feel safe.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Highly Sensitive,"Trust insecurity means someone is controlling by nature; Jealousy is proof of love; More surveillance creates more safety; If you trust once, you should never need repair again.",Core Insecurities; Trust Repair; Boundaries; Consent Frameworks; DADT,trust-insecurity; safety-needs; jealousy; transparency; relationship-security
109,Turn-Offs,Signal & Cue,"Stimuli, contexts, or interactions that reduce desire or arousal, often acting as “brakes” on sexual response.","Turn-offs can be physical (discomfort, fatigue), emotional (pressure, conflict), cognitive (worry, shame scripts), or contextual (low privacy). In reports, turn-offs help couples reduce friction by changing conditions rather than blaming attraction. They are especially important for consent clarity: discomfort signals matter.",Feeling rushed or pressured; Conflict or unresolved tension; Low privacy; Criticism or insecurity-triggering comments.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Turn-offs mean you don’t love your partner; You should ignore turn-offs to be “spontaneous”; Turn-offs are just excuses; If you remove turn-offs, sex is guaranteed.",Arousal Breaks; Arousal Brake; Cortisol; Energy Level; Emotional Safety,turn-offs; sexual-inhibitors; arousal-brakes; libido-blockers; relationship-stress; cross-cultural
110,Turn-Ons,Signal & Cue,"Stimuli, contexts, or interactions that reliably increase desire or arousal for a person.","Turn-ons can be sensory (touch, scent), emotional (reassurance, affection), cognitive (fantasy, anticipation), or relational (being chosen). They often change with stress, privacy, and life stage. In reports, turn-ons are best used as practical “what helps” cues—not demands—and should always be paired with consent and pacing.",Slow kissing and warmth; Compliments and feeling desired; Privacy + time; Playful flirtation and anticipation texts.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Turn-ons are universal; If something is a turn-on once it must always work; Turn-ons justify pushing a partner; Turn-ons equal consent.,Turn-Offs; Arousal Style; Arousal Curve; Being Seen; Being Safe,turn-ons; sexual-triggers; desire-accelerators; arousal-cues; couples-intimacy; global-dating
111,Typical Beliefs,Framework & Model,"A report dimension describing common beliefs and assumptions someone holds about sex, desire, roles, and what a “good relationship” should look like.","Typical beliefs often come from culture, religion, family messaging, and past relationships. They shape consent language, initiation expectations, shame levels, and what feels “allowed.” In geo-diverse reporting, beliefs should be discussed respectfully and with options: keep values while updating unhelpful myths.",Belief that sex should be spontaneous and “natural”; Belief that saying no is disrespectful; Belief that good partners should mind-read without talking.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,Beliefs are facts; Beliefs can’t change; Different beliefs mean incompatibility; Beliefs justify pressuring a partner.,Social Software; Sexual Script; Sexual Tabooization; Consent Frameworks,typical-beliefs; relationship-assumptions; sexual-scripts; cultural-norms; sex-myths
112,Validation,Framework & Model,"A report signal describing how strongly someone’s desire, confidence, or satisfaction depends on feeling wanted, praised, or chosen.","Validation needs are human and vary widely. High validation sensitivity can amplify performance anxiety and reassurance-seeking, especially in cultures with strong sexual shame scripts. Healthy use means asking directly for reassurance without using guilt or pressure, and building internal self-trust alongside partner feedback.",Desire rises after compliments; Arousal drops when feedback feels unclear; Someone avoids initiation due to fear of rejection and needs gentle reassurance.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,Needing validation is manipulative; Validation should override boundaries; Praise will fix everything; Validation need means low maturity.,Approval Seeker; Performance Anxiety; Sexual Confidence; Core Insecurities,validation; reassurance; feeling-desired; approval-needs; confidence
113,Validation-Based Arousal,Pattern & Dynamic,"An arousal pattern where feeling desired, admired, or chosen strongly increases desire and sexual confidence.","Validation-based arousal is common and often shows up as responsiveness to compliments, attention, or erotic “being seen” cues. It can become fragile when self-worth depends entirely on external feedback, increasing performance anxiety or reassurance loops. Healthy support balances partner praise with self-trust, clear boundaries, and non-pressure initiation.",Desire rises after compliments or flirtation; Arousal drops when feedback feels unclear; Feeling “wanted” is the strongest turn-on cue.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Needing validation is manipulative; Praise should override boundaries; If you need reassurance, you’re incompatible; Validation-based arousal means you’re insecure forever.",Validation; Approval Seeker; Performance Anxiety; Being Seen,validation-based-arousal; feeling-desired; praise; reassurance; sexual-confidence; modern-dating
114,Voyeurism,Identity & Orientation,An erotic interest in watching others in sexual or intimate contexts—ethical only when everyone involved consents and privacy is protected.,"Reports must distinguish consensual voyeurism (e.g., watching a partner, consensual adult content, agreed-upon situations) from non-consensual spying, which is harmful and illegal. Healthy practice includes explicit permission, clear boundaries, and strong privacy/digital safety practices, especially across regions with different legal norms.","Enjoying consensual watching with a partner; Watching consensual adult content as fantasy; Joining a consensual, rules-based environment with explicit consent (where legal).","Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Voyeurism is always spying; Watching equals consent for action; If you like watching, you can ignore boundaries; Voyeurism must be public or risky to count.",Exhibitionism; Exhibitionist Performer; Ethical Constraints; Consent Frameworks,voyeurism; consensual-watching; erotic-visual; privacy; consent-first; kink-education
115,Wave-Based Arousal,Pattern & Dynamic,"An arousal pattern where desire builds and ebbs in waves, often needing sustained safety, time, and attunement rather than quick triggers.","Wave-based arousal often benefits from slow pacing, emotional safety, and reduced performance pressure. It can be especially common in long-term partnerships and during life stages with high stress or low privacy. Reports should highlight that waves are normal and can be very pleasurable—without needing a single “peak.”","Arousal builds gradually during extended touch; Desire returns in cycles during intimacy; Needs time and privacy to crest; Enjoys longer, connected sessions.",Desire & Arousal,General,"Wave arousal is low libido; If it takes time, attraction is missing; Waves should lead to orgasm every time; Wave patterns aren’t compatible with spontaneous partners.",State-Based Reward; Optimal Sexual States; Arousal Curve; Presence vs Performance,wave-based-arousal; slow-build; responsive-arousal; intimacy-pacing; pleasure-styles; couples-tools
