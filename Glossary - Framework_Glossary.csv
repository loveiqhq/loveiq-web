1,Agency (Intentional Growth),Practice & Skill,"The capacity to make deliberate, values-aligned choices in relationships and sexuality, including learning, boundary-setting, and behavior change over time.","Agency supports healthier intimacy by shifting from “this just happens to me” to “I can choose my pace, communicate needs, and build skills.” It’s especially important in taboo-heavy contexts because it empowers respectful self-definition while maintaining consent and non-harm principles.",Choosing to pause when unsure instead of pushing through; Practicing clearer initiation and consent language; Seeking education or support to reduce shame and improve communication.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,"Agency means total control over desire; If you have agency, you never struggle; Agency means ignoring culture or community; Agency replaces empathy and relational negotiation.",Non-Harm Principles; Consent Frameworks; Reflective Prompts; Guided Self-Understanding,agency; intentional-growth; self-efficacy; consent-skills; relationship-tools; empowerment
2,Aggregation & Coarsening,Data & Research Method,Privacy techniques that reduce detail by summarizing data (aggregation) or converting precise values into broader buckets (coarsening).,"These techniques lower re-identification risk while keeping analytic value, especially for geo reporting (country/region comparisons). Coarsening should be done thoughtfully to avoid distorting outcomes or hiding meaningful disparities; documentation helps users interpret results correctly.",Reporting age bands instead of exact age; Showing country-level results instead of neighborhood; Replacing exact timestamps with month or quarter.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Aggregation guarantees anonymity; Coarser data is always less biased; Coarsening makes the data useless; Aggregation means consent and governance are unnecessary.,Suppression of Rare Combinations; Re-Identification Risk; Normalized Dimension Values; Gates / Guardrails,aggregation; coarsening; privacy-techniques; geo-reporting; deidentification; data-minimization
3,Alignment Profiles,Product Artifact,"A structured snapshot showing how a person’s traits, needs, and preferences align with one or more relational or erotic patterns in a matching framework.","Alignment profiles are often generated from surveys or guided self-assessments and can help people see strengths, friction points, and negotiation areas. They are best used as conversation starters, not as labels or diagnoses. Good profiles include uncertainty, cultural context, and actionable suggestions rather than rigid scores.",A report highlights high match on communication style but mismatch on sexual frequency expectations; A couple uses a profile to discuss boundaries and turn-on cues; A profile suggests “try” options based on shared modalities.,Product & Assessment,General,An alignment profile is a medical diagnosis; A low score means the relationship cannot work; Profiles remove the need for communication; Profiles are universally accurate across cultures without adjustment.,Compatibility Engine; Deep Survey; Soft Survey; Validity; Reliability; Desire Discrepancy,alignment-profile; relationship-assessment; compatibility; survey-results; personalized-insights; cross-cultural
4,Anonymized Research Access,Product Artifact,Access to research data where identifying details are removed so analysis can be done while reducing privacy risk for individuals.,"In practice, “anonymized access” usually involves strong de-identification plus governance: data minimization, risk review, and rules for cross-border/EU-style privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR-aligned principles). Because true anonymity can be hard to guarantee, responsible programs pair technical controls with legal/ethical guardrails and ongoing monitoring.",Researchers use a de-identified dataset to study relationship wellbeing trends; A platform shares aggregated survey outcomes with a university partner; A research portal only exposes anonymized outputs and blocks raw exports.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,"Anonymized means “zero risk”; Anonymized equals pseudonymized; Once anonymized, data can be shared freely anywhere; Anonymization removes the need for consent and governance.",Re-Identification Risk; Controlled Research Environments; Tiered Access Approach; Aggregation & Coarsening; Gates / Guardrails,anonymized-research; deidentification; privacy-by-design; gdpr-aligned; research-access; global-data
5,Archaic Algorithms,Framework & Model,"A metaphor for older, evolution-shaped patterns in attention, attraction, and threat detection that still influence modern desire and relationship behavior.","“Archaic algorithms” refers to fast, automatic mental shortcuts—like novelty-seeking, status sensitivity, or danger scanning—that once helped survival but can misfire in today’s social and digital environments. In sexuality, these shortcuts can amplify comparison, performance pressure, or impulsive cue-reactivity. The goal is awareness and choice, not blaming biology.",Feeling pulled toward novelty even while valuing commitment; Interpreting a partner’s neutral tone as rejection and losing arousal; Becoming more aroused by “forbidden” contexts because they feel high-stakes.,Desire & Arousal,General,Archaic algorithms mean you can’t control your behavior; They justify jealousy or coercion; Everyone’s algorithms are the same; Modern culture has no effect on desire.,Evolutionary Mismatch; Arousal Accelerator; Arousal Brake; Sexual Script; Desire Cues,archaic-algorithms; evolutionary-psychology; desire-patterns; novelty-seeking; threat-detection; sexual-context
6,Archetypal Alignment,Pattern & Dynamic,"The degree to which a person’s attraction and desire feel “in sync” with recurring symbolic themes (archetypes) they find compelling, such as protector, rebel, nurturer, or explorer.","Archetypal alignment is a way to talk about the stories and roles that make attraction feel meaningful. It can help couples understand why certain dynamics are exciting and others feel flat, without reducing attraction to looks alone. Archetypes are culturally shaped, so the same theme may be expressed differently across regions and media traditions.",Someone is most attracted to confident leadership energy and feels bored without it; A person finds tenderness and caretaking deeply erotic; Partners negotiate playful role dynamics that match shared fantasies.,Identity & Attraction,Sensitive,"Archetypes prove there is one “true” partner for you; Alignment is fixed and cannot evolve; Archetypal talk is the same as gender stereotypes; If alignment is low, the relationship has no chance.",Fantasy; Desire Cues; Kink Curiosity; Sexual Signature; Relationship Form Preference,archetypal-alignment; attraction-patterns; erotic-archetypes; relationship-chemistry; desire; cultural-stories
7,Archetypal Probabilities,Data & Research Method,"A way of thinking about attraction as likelihoods: certain archetypal themes and dynamics are more or less probable to feel erotic for a given person based on history, culture, and temperament.","This term is useful for exploration: instead of treating preferences as mysterious, people can test hypotheses about what themes reliably increase arousal or emotional connection. It also avoids rigid labels by emphasizing probabilities rather than certainties. Because media and culture influence archetypes, it encourages checking whether a preference is personally authentic or socially inherited.",Noticing you’re more likely to feel desire when there’s playful challenge than when everything is predictable; Experimenting with different initiation styles to see what themes land; Realizing a “type” changes after major life experiences.,Identity & Attraction,General,"Probabilities guarantee outcomes; If you know the archetype, you can manipulate someone; Preferences can be predicted without consent and communication; Archetypal probabilities are scientifically exact measurements.",Archetypal Alignment; Desire Cues; Arousal Map; Sexual Signature; Neural Plasticity,archetypal-probabilities; attraction-likelihood; erotic-themes; self-discovery; dating-insights; desire-cues
8,Archetype Probability Distribution,Metric & Measurement,"A probability-based output that shows how strongly a person’s profile matches multiple archetypes, expressed as a distribution across options.","A distribution can be peaked (one clear match) or broad (several plausible matches). Showing a distribution can reduce over-labeling by making ambiguity visible. For geo/cross-cultural use, it helps to include plain-language explanations so probabilities don’t get misread as identity categories.","A user sees 55% Explorer, 30% Connector, 15% Stabilizer; Two archetypes are close, prompting reflection rather than a single label; Distribution shifts after new survey answers or life changes.",Product & Assessment,General,The top archetype is your permanent identity; Lower probabilities don’t matter; A broad distribution means the assessment failed; Probabilities can replace conversation and self-reflection.,Softmax Normalization; Distribution “Sharpness”; Archetype Prototype Profile; Interpretive Depth; Alignment Profiles,archetype-probabilities; probability-distribution; assessment-results; matching; self-discovery; global-interpretation
9,Archetype Probability Distributions (Full Signature),Metric & Measurement,"A full probability profile showing how strongly a person matches each archetype, represented as a distribution rather than a single label.","Full signatures help prevent over-labeling by showing nuance (e.g., two close matches). They’re especially useful in multicultural settings because they allow “both/and” interpretations and can be paired with plain-language explanations, uncertainty notes, and guardrails to avoid identity-like claims.",A user sees probabilities across 8 archetypes rather than one winner; A report highlights top 3 archetypes plus “close alternatives”; The distribution is tracked over time to reflect change.,Product & Assessment,General,The top archetype is your fixed identity; The distribution is a diagnosis; Lower probabilities are irrelevant; More archetypes always means more truth.,Archetype Probability Distribution; Softmax Normalization; Distribution “Sharpness”; Interpretive Depth,archetype-signature; probability-profile; full-distribution; assessment-results; explainability; global-insights
10,Archetype Prototype Profile,Product Artifact,"A reference profile that represents an archetype’s typical dimension pattern, used as a comparison target in matching or interpretation.","Prototype profiles can be created from theory, expert design, or aggregated user data, and they should be reviewed for bias and cultural fit. They help people understand “which pattern you resemble most” without forcing a single label. Good products also show confidence levels and alternative close matches.",A “nurturer” prototype emphasizes bonding and reassurance; A “explorer” prototype emphasizes novelty and curiosity; Users see which prototype they most closely match plus a second-best alternative.,Product & Assessment,General,"Prototypes are stereotypes and always harmful; Matching to a prototype fixes your identity permanently; Prototypes are universal across all cultures; If you don’t match a prototype, the test failed.",Archetype Probability Distribution; Similarity-Based Scoring; Alignment Profiles; Bias; Validity,archetype-prototype; reference-profile; matching-framework; personality-patterns; assessment-design; cultural-fit
11,Arousal Non-Concordance (Genital–Subjective),Pattern & Dynamic,"A situation where genital arousal and felt mental arousal do not match (for example, the body reacts while the person feels emotionally unaroused—or vice versa).","Non-concordance is common and not a sign of deception or dysfunction on its own. Genital response can be triggered by friction, novelty, or automatic physiology, while subjective arousal depends strongly on meaning, safety, and desire. Understanding non-concordance supports consent clarity: bodily reactions are not the same as wanting or agreeing.",Someone experiences lubrication/erection without feeling desire; A person feels turned on mentally but their body is slow to respond due to stress or medication; Genital response fades when anxiety spikes even though attraction remains.,Consent & Boundaries,Highly Sensitive,"If the body responds, consent is automatic; Non-concordance means you are broken; Non-concordance only happens after trauma; Arousal mismatch proves you don’t like your partner.",Arousal; Consent; Boundaries; Cognitive and Somatic Dissonance; Arousal Brake; Stress And Desire,arousal-nonconcordance; genital-subjective; consent-clarity; mind-body; sexual-response; safety-first
12,Arousal Style,Trait & Disposition,"A person’s typical pattern for how sexual arousal starts, builds, and stays present across different contexts and partners.","Arousal style describes the “how” of getting turned on: pacing, preferred initiation, sensory intensity, and what helps someone stay engaged. It can shift with stress, hormones, health, relationship safety, and life stage, but many people notice repeating themes. Mapping arousal style helps partners reduce guesswork and communicate more clearly about libido, turn-ons, and turn-offs.",Someone needs slow build-up and emotional connection before arousal rises; A person’s arousal spikes quickly with novelty but drops if they feel rushed; Arousal is strongest with cuddling first and plenty of privacy.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Arousal style is the same as sexual orientation; If your arousal style differs from your partner’s you are incompatible; Arousal style never changes; Arousal style can be forced with willpower.,Arousal; Arousal Map; Spontaneous Desire; Responsive Desire; Turn-On Cues; Turn-Off Cues,arousal-style; libido-pattern; sexual-arousal; desire-building; intimacy-compatibility; global-relationships
13,Autonomic Nervous System (ANS),Data & Research Method,"The part of the nervous system that automatically regulates arousal states such as fight/flight, rest/digest, and physiological readiness for intimacy.","The ANS influences sexual response through stress hormones, muscle tone, breathing, and blood flow. When the system reads “unsafe,” inhibition rises; when it reads “safe,” connection and arousal are easier. Understanding the ANS supports practical interventions like reducing stress, improving privacy, and building emotional safety.",A person’s desire increases when they feel relaxed and unhurried; Conflict triggers a stress response that makes arousal difficult; Gentle touch and reassurance help someone shift into a calmer state before intimacy.,Desire & Arousal,General,"ANS regulation is the same as “being calm all the time”; If your ANS is activated, you cannot consent; Nervous-system language excuses hurtful behavior; ANS concepts are only relevant for clinical therapy.",Polyvagal Theory; Vagus Nerve; Arousal Brake; Emotional Safety; Stress And Desire,autonomic-nervous-system; ans; stress-response; sexual-arousal; safety-cues; physiology
14,Base Code (Evolutionary Ethology),Framework & Model,"A shorthand for evolution-informed patterns in mating, bonding, and social behavior that shape human sexuality across many cultures and contexts.","Ethology studies behavior in natural settings; in this glossary, “base code” refers to recurring drives like attachment, status, novelty, pair-bonding, and caregiving. These patterns interact with personal history and culture, so they’re tendencies, not rules. Using the concept responsibly means staying away from stereotypes and focusing on individual variation.",A person feels most bonded after affectionate touch and reassurance; Novelty and anticipation increase arousal for someone even in a long-term relationship; Feeling socially evaluated can lower desire via stress and self-consciousness.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Base code determines your destiny; Evolutionary explanations are always sexist or universally true; If a pattern is “evolutionary,” it’s morally acceptable; Culture and learning don’t matter.",Evolutionary Mismatch; Desire; Attachment Style; Arousal Accelerator; Arousal Brake,evolutionary-ethology; base-code; human-mating; pair-bonding; attraction-patterns; sexual-behavior
15,Biochemical Reward Dynamics,Framework & Model,"How reward-related biology (motivation, bonding, and pleasure systems) influences desire, attraction, and sexual satisfaction over time.","Reward dynamics often involve dopamine-linked motivation, bonding chemistry (often discussed via oxytocin/vasopressin), and comfort/pleasure pathways (endogenous opioids). These systems interact with learning and context, so they do not determine behavior on their own. The concept is useful for explaining why novelty can feel exciting, why safety can increase desire, and why stress can blunt pleasure—across many cultures and life stages.","Anticipation increases desire during dating and early romance; After a supportive conversation, arousal rises because safety cues increase reward value; High chronic stress reduces pleasure and motivation even with attraction present.",Desire & Arousal,General,Sex is only chemicals and nothing else matters; Reward biology excuses harmful behavior; Novelty is required for long-term desire; Biology alone determines compatibility.,Neurochemical “Big Three” (dopamine / oxytocin-vasopressin / endogenous opioids); Limbic System; Evolutionary Hardware; Stress And Desire; Arousal Accelerator,biochemical-reward; sexual-neurochemistry; dopamine; bonding; pleasure-system; libido-science
16,Body Map,Practice & Skill,"A personal map of what kinds of touch, pressure, pace, and context feel pleasurable, neutral, or uncomfortable across different parts of the body.","A body map can be created solo or with a partner as a communication tool. It supports consent by clarifying boundaries and preferences, and it can evolve over time with health, stress, and experience. Because comfort with touch varies across cultures and individuals, body mapping is most useful when it is collaborative and non-judgmental.","Marking areas that feel good with light touch versus firm pressure; Noting that certain touches are enjoyable only when emotionally connected; Updating preferences after childbirth, illness, or a period of stress.",Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"A body map is permanent and should never change; If you have a body map, partners should “know exactly what to do”; Body mapping replaces conversation in the moment; Discomfort means you’re not attracted to your partner.",Arousal Map; Consent; Boundaries; Arousal Window; Aftercare,body-map; touch-preferences; pleasure-mapping; consent-communication; arousal-awareness; sexual-wellbeing
17,Cognitive and Somatic Dissonance,State & Experience,"A mind–body mismatch where thoughts and intentions differ from physical sensations, arousal, or emotional responses in a sexual or intimate context.","People can feel “yes” mentally while their body feels tense, numb, or unresponsive—or the reverse. Dissonance can be shaped by stress, safety cues, past learning, medication, health, or shame, and it is not a moral failure. Tracking the mismatch helps clarify what conditions support comfort, consent, and pleasure.",Wanting to have sex but feeling physically shut down from stress; Being physically aroused while emotionally uncomfortable and choosing to slow down; Feeling affectionate but noticing your body is bracing during touch.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"If your body reacts, you must want it; If you love your partner, your body should always cooperate; Dissonance means you are broken; Dissonance can be solved by “trying harder.”",Arousal; Arousal Brake; Arousal Window; Consent; Aftercare,mind-body-mismatch; cognitive-somatic-dissonance; sexual-arousal; consent-awareness; nervous-system; sexual-wellbeing
18,Cognitive Consonance,State & Experience,"A felt sense of alignment between beliefs, values, and actions that reduces internal conflict and supports ease and integrity in intimacy decisions.","Cognitive consonance often shows up as clarity: people know what they want, what they don't want, and how to communicate it without self-betrayal. It can be strengthened by values clarification, honest agreements, and consent-centered choices. Consonance does not require perfection; it allows complexity while reducing shame-based contradiction.",Feeling calm about a boundary you communicated clearly; Partners agreeing on relationship form and acting consistently with it; Choosing pacing that matches your comfort rather than external expectations.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,General,"Consonance means never feeling uncertain; If you feel conflict, you are failing; Consonance requires identical values between partners; Consonance is the same as suppression of desire.",Cognitive and Somatic Dissonance; Consent Frameworks; Ethical Constraints; Relationship Form Preference; Emotional Safety,cognitive-consonance; values-alignment; integrity; consent-clarity; self-trust
19,Consent Frameworks,Framework & Model,"Structured models for understanding and communicating consent, boundaries, and mutual agreement before and during intimacy.","Consent frameworks emphasize that consent is informed, freely given, specific, and reversible, and that it should be checked as context changes. They help couples build shared language for pacing, boundaries, and aftercare. Because norms vary across countries and communities, good frameworks also encourage cultural humility while keeping the core principle-no pressure and clear agreement-non-negotiable.","Using a simple ""green/yellow/red"" check-in during intimacy; Agreeing on a safe word and aftercare plan for exploration; Clarifying what ""not tonight"" means and how to reconnect without guilt.",Consent & Boundaries,Sensitive,"Consent is a one-time yes; Consent ruins spontaneity; If you're in a relationship, consent is assumed; Consent is only about legal risk, not mutual care.",Consent; Boundaries; Aftercare; Signal Mismatch; Ethical Constraints,consent-framework; enthusiastic-consent; boundary-setting; safer-intimacy; communication
20,Context-Sensitive Assessments,Framework & Model,"Assessments that interpret answers differently based on relevant context such as relationship stage, cultural norms, stress level, health, or living situation.","Context sensitivity prevents misleading conclusions like treating low desire during burnout as ""low attraction,"" or applying one culture's scripts to another. It often uses branching logic, localized examples, and clear caveats. Done well, it increases fairness and usefulness while keeping core safety standards (consent and non-harm) consistent.","Adjusting interpretation for postpartum, long-distance, or high-stress periods; Offering culture-neutral alternatives for communication prompts; Flagging privacy constraints when living with family or roommates.",Product & Assessment,General,Context is an excuse to ignore patterns; Context-sensitive results can't be compared at all; Context is only about culture and not about life stage; Context eliminates personal responsibility for communication.,Progressive Precision; Interpretive Depth; Cultural Mismatch; Stress And Desire; Gates / Guardrails,context-sensitive; culturally-aware; life-stage; adaptive-insights; fair-assessment
21,Controlled Research Environments,Product Artifact,"Secure settings where researchers can analyze sensitive data under strict access controls, monitoring, and limits on exporting results.","Controlled environments can include secure enclaves, vetted user access, logging, output checking, and “no raw export” rules. They help balance scientific value and privacy protection—especially for international collaborations where cross-border data handling is complex.",A secure enclave that only allows aggregated outputs; Research access via VPN with audit logs; Output review before releasing tables that could reveal rare combinations.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,"Controlled environments are unnecessary if data is anonymized; If researchers are trustworthy, controls aren’t needed; Controls make research impossible; Any controlled environment is automatically compliant everywhere.",Tiered Access Approach; Anonymized Research Access; Gates / Guardrails; Re-Identification Risk,controlled-environment; secure-research; data-enclave; privacy-controls; audited-access; safe-output
22,Core Insecurities,Trait & Disposition,"Deep worries about adequacy, desirability, or safety that can shape intimacy patterns, communication, and sexual response.","Core insecurities often show up as avoidance, reassurance-seeking, jealousy, or performance pressure. They are influenced by attachment history, cultural standards, and past relational experiences. Bringing insecurities into the open—gently and without blame—can reduce arousal brakes and improve relational attunement.",Someone avoids initiating sex out of fear of rejection; A partner needs frequent reassurance about attractiveness; Body image concerns reduce presence during intimacy.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,"Insecurity means you are not ready for a relationship; Partners should never need reassurance; Insecurities are fixed and cannot heal; If you feel insecure, your partner is doing something wrong.",Attachment Style; Rejection Sensitivity; Validation Need; Body Image Impact; Arousal Brake; Relational Attunement,core-insecurities; attachment; reassurance; jealousy; body-image; intimacy-anxiety
23,Core Modalities,Framework & Model,"The primary channels through which a person most easily experiences desire and pleasure, such as sensory touch, emotional connection, fantasy, novelty, or power dynamics.","Core modalities help translate “what turns me on” into categories that are easier to communicate and experiment with. Many people have multiple modalities, and their weighting can change with stress, safety, and relationship stage. Using modalities well means staying flexible and consent-centered rather than forcing a fixed label.",A person is mainly sensory and needs good touch and pacing; Another person’s strongest modality is fantasy and mental imagery; A couple discovers that emotional connection plus novelty is their most reliable combination.,Desire & Arousal,General,"You only have one modality; Modalities are the same as love languages; If your partner has different modalities, you’re incompatible; Modalities determine what you must do to be “good in bed.”",Arousal Map; Desire; Fantasy; Kink Curiosity; Sexual Signature,core-modalities; pleasure-channels; desire-and-arousal; erotic-preferences; sexual-communication; compatibility
24,Cultural Mismatch,Pattern & Dynamic,"A gap between a person’s desires, relationship needs, or sexual expectations and the cultural norms, scripts, or messages they have learned to follow.","Cultural mismatch often shows up as guilt, confusion, or conflict when personal arousal patterns or intimacy needs don’t neatly fit local norms, family beliefs, or religious messaging. It can happen in any region or community and is especially common in cross-cultural relationships or after migration. Naming the mismatch helps people separate “what I was taught” from “what works for me and my partner(s).”","Someone wants open, direct sexual communication but grew up where sex was never discussed; A couple has different assumptions about monogamy because they were raised in different cultures; A person enjoys touch but feels shame because affectionate behavior was labeled inappropriate at home.",Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,A cultural mismatch means something is wrong with you; Cultural mismatch is only an issue in “traditional” countries; The only solution is to reject your culture entirely; Cultural mismatch can’t be negotiated within a relationship.,Sexual Script; Relationship Form Preference; Boundaries; Desire Discrepancy; Consent,cultural-mismatch; sexual-scripts; relationship-norms; cross-cultural-relationships; intimacy-expectations; sexual-wellbeing
25,Curated Knowledge Base,Product Artifact,"A vetted, maintained library of concepts, definitions, examples, and policies used to keep guidance consistent and safe.","A curated knowledge base is designed for reliability: content is reviewed, updated, versioned, and often localized. It can include a glossary, consent guidelines, communication templates, and cultural notes. In AI-assisted products, curation supports consistency across languages and regions and makes it easier to audit what users are being told.",A glossary of key sexuality and relationship terms; Localized examples that fit different cultural contexts; A policy library that defines what recommendations are allowed.,Product & Assessment,General,"A knowledge base is the same as the open internet; If it's curated, it's complete and always up to date; Curation eliminates the need for user context; A knowledge base can't contain bias.",Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); Pattern Libraries (by Modality); Ethical Constraints; Interpretive Depth; Glossary,curated-knowledge-base; vetted-content; localization; policy-library; glossary
26,Curiosity & Exploration Orientation,Trait & Disposition,"A person’s tendency to explore new ideas, experiences, or dynamics in sexuality and relationships, including openness to learning and experimentation.","High exploration orientation often pairs with play, novelty, and growth mindset, while lower exploration orientation may prioritize predictability, safety, and routine comfort. Neither is superior; compatibility comes from negotiated pace, consent, and boundaries. This trait can be shaped by culture, taboo levels, and prior experiences with safety or judgment.",A couple enjoys learning new ways to communicate about pleasure; Someone is open to gentle experimentation but wants clear stop signals; A person prefers familiar routines and explores slowly over time.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Sensitive,High curiosity means someone will cross boundaries; Low curiosity means someone is boring; Exploration orientation determines sexual skill; Curiosity should override consent if both are “in love.”,Taboo Curiosity; Role Play; Roleplay Boundaries; Consent; Boundaries; Routine Comfort,curiosity-orientation; sexual-exploration; novelty; growth-mindset; kink-curiosity; consent-first
27,Deterministic Scoring,Metric & Measurement,"A rule-based scoring approach where the same inputs always produce the same outputs using fixed formulas, thresholds, or weights.","Deterministic scoring is valued for transparency and explainability: users can understand how answers map to results. It works well for stable constructs and clear rules (e.g., hard boundaries), but it can miss nuance when context shifts or when measurement noise is high. In global products, deterministic rules often need localization and fairness testing so they don't encode cultural assumptions.",Using fixed dimension weights to compute a compatibility score; Blocking a recommendation when a non-negotiable boundary conflicts; Mapping Likert responses to a 0-100 scale with a consistent formula.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,"Deterministic means accurate; Deterministic means unbiased; Deterministic scoring can replace human judgment and communication; If outputs are fixed, they are universally valid across cultures.",Psychometric Scoring Layer; Dimension Weights; Similarity-Based Scoring; Gates / Guardrails; Normalized Dimension Values,deterministic-scoring; explainable-scores; rule-based; measurement; fairness-testing
28,Dimension Vector (Coordinate Vector),Metric & Measurement,"A set of dimension scores represented as a vector, allowing a person’s profile to be compared mathematically to other profiles or prototypes.","Vectors make it possible to compute similarity, distance, and clustering in a structured way. In a relationship assessment context, a vector might include desire style, communication style, boundaries comfort, and other measured dimensions. Interpretation still matters: vectors summarize patterns, not the full nuance of a human relationship.",Representing a user by scores on 12 dimensions and comparing to partner or archetype; Calculating a similarity score between two profiles; Visualizing a profile as a point in a multi-dimensional space.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,A vector fully captures a person; Vector similarity equals real-life compatibility; More dimensions always means better truth; Vectors are culture-free and need no calibration.,Similarity-Based Scoring; Dimension Weights; Normalized Dimension Values; Compatibility Engine; Alignment Profiles,dimension-vector; coordinate-vector; profile-metrics; similarity; matching-algorithms; relationship-analytics
29,Dimension Weights,Metric & Measurement,Numerical weights that control how much each dimension contributes to an overall score or recommendation in an assessment or matching system.,"Weights reflect product priorities and value judgments (for example, making consent compatibility more important than novelty). They can be fixed, user-adjustable, or learned from data, but they should be tested for fairness and robustness. Transparent weighting improves explainability and helps users understand why they received a result.",A system weights boundaries and consent higher than fantasy similarity; Users choose to prioritize emotional intimacy over novelty; Weighting reduces the impact of a dimension with low reliability.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Weights are purely objective; Higher weight means the dimension is morally superior; Users should never see weights; Weights can’t be tuned for different cultures or populations.,Similarity-Based Scoring; Validity; Reliability; Gates / Guardrails; Targeted Boosts,dimension-weights; weighting; scoring-model; fairness; personalization; explainable-scoring
30,Direct Identifiers,Data & Research Method,"Data fields that can identify a person on their own, such as full name, exact email address, phone number, or government-issued ID.","Direct identifiers are high-risk for privacy and typically require strict handling: minimization, encryption, access controls, and separation from analytic datasets. Many compliance frameworks (including EU/GDPR-aligned practices) treat direct identifiers as highly sensitive because misuse can cause immediate harm.",Email address stored separately from survey answers; Phone number collected only for account recovery; Removing names before sharing data with analysts.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",Sensitive,"Removing direct identifiers makes data anonymous; Hashing equals anonymization; If users consent once, direct identifiers can be used for anything; Direct identifiers are safe if stored internally.",Quasi-Identifiers; Re-Identification Risk; Tiered Access Approach; Ethical Constraints,direct-identifiers; pii; personal-data; privacy-controls; gdpr; data-minimization
31,Distribution “Sharpness”,Metric & Measurement,"A measure of how concentrated or decisive a probability distribution is, indicating whether results point strongly to one option or spread across many.",Sharpness is often adjusted with a temperature-like parameter or measured with entropy-based metrics. High sharpness can feel clear but may overstate certainty; low sharpness communicates nuance but may feel less satisfying. Products should pair sharpness with interpretive guidance to prevent overconfidence and reduce mislabeling.,A report notes “high certainty” when one archetype dominates; A broad distribution triggers a suggestion to explore multiple modalities; Changing a sharpness parameter makes results less absolute for early onboarding.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Sharper is always better; Sharpness proves the model is accurate; Low sharpness means the user lied; Sharpness should be hidden because it’s “too technical.”,Softmax Normalization; Archetype Probability Distribution; Interpretive Depth; Validity; Reliability,distribution-sharpness; entropy; temperature-parameter; confidence-metrics; explainability; model-calibration
32,Dual Control Model of Sexual Response,Framework & Model,"A research-backed model that explains sexual arousal as the balance between excitation (accelerators) and inhibition (brakes), shaped by context, meaning, and safety.","The Dual Control Model is often used to normalize why desire varies: the same person can feel highly sexual in one context and shut down in another. It supports practical troubleshooting by identifying accelerators to add and brakes to reduce, rather than blaming libido or compatibility. The model is used internationally in sex research and therapy, though it should be applied with cultural humility and individual nuance.",A couple improves sex by reducing stress triggers (brakes) and adding playful initiation (accelerators); Someone notices arousal is easier on vacation than during work deadlines; A person realizes privacy concerns are a stronger brake than attraction is an accelerator.,Desire & Arousal,General,"The model means arousal is purely mechanical; If you add enough accelerators, consent is automatic; Brakes are always trauma-related; The model replaces communication about needs and boundaries.",Sexual Excitation System (SES); Sexual Inhibition System (SIS); Arousal Accelerator; Arousal Brake; Desire Discrepancy,dual-control-model; sexual-response; arousal-accelerators; arousal-brakes; libido-variability; sex-research
33,Educational Poverty (Sexual Education Deficit),Pattern & Dynamic,"A widespread lack of accessible, accurate sexual education that leaves people without practical knowledge about bodies, consent, pleasure, and healthy relationships.","This deficit can vary by country, school system, and community norms, but often results in shame, misinformation, and reliance on peers or online content for learning. Addressing it typically involves culturally respectful education that includes consent, anatomy, communication skills, and wellbeing—not only risk prevention.",Adults unsure about anatomy or arousal; Partners lacking shared language for boundaries; People learning “how sex works” mainly from porn or rumors.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Sexual education is only about pregnancy and STIs; If you had biology class, you’re fully educated; Education causes risky behavior; The deficit is an individual’s fault.",Systemic Gap in Sexual Education; Sexual Tabooization; Consent Frameworks; Guided Self-Understanding,sexual-education-deficit; sex-ed-gap; consent-skills; anatomy-literacy; global-health; stigma-reduction
34,Embodied Integration,Practice & Skill,"A skill of aligning thoughts, values, and communication with real-time body sensations so intimacy decisions feel grounded, consensual, and present.","Embodied integration builds a bridge between insight and action: noticing tension, breath, and emotional shifts-and adjusting pacing, touch, or boundaries accordingly. It supports pleasure and consent by helping people detect subtle ""yes/no/maybe"" signals early. It is adaptable across cultures because it emphasizes personal signals rather than any single sexual script.",Pausing to notice body tension and asking to slow down; Using breath and grounding to stay present during touch; Naming a shift from curiosity to overwhelm and choosing a different activity.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Embodied work is only for trauma; Body cues should override verbal consent; If you are integrated, sex will always work; Embodied practices replace medical care for persistent symptoms.",Somatic Integration; Autonomic Nervous System (ANS); Cognitive and Somatic Dissonance; Consent; Presence vs Performance,embodied-integration; somatic-skills; body-awareness; consent-clarity; nervous-system
35,Energy Level,Trait & Disposition,"A person’s typical level of physical and emotional energy available for dating, intimacy, and sex, which influences pacing and frequency preferences.","Energy level is affected by sleep, health, workload, parenting, mental health, and stress—not just attraction. Many libido conflicts are actually energy conflicts. Talking about energy level supports practical solutions (timing, planning, reducing stressors) and reduces personalizing a partner’s fatigue as rejection.","A couple schedules intimacy earlier in the evening because late nights reduce energy; A partner wants shorter, more frequent connection because long sessions feel draining; Desire increases on weekends when recovery time is available.",Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,Low energy equals low attraction; High energy means someone always wants sex; Energy issues can be solved by pushing through; Energy level is purely a personality trait and not health-related.,Stress And Desire; Desire Discrepancy; Routine Comfort; Arousal Brake; Sexual Frequency Expectations,energy-level; fatigue-and-libido; sexual-frequency; stress-management; relationship-planning; wellbeing
36,Erotic Polarity,Trait & Disposition,"A preferred erotic dynamic where partners feel energized by contrast (for example, leading/following, giving/receiving, assertive/receptive) in consensual ways.","Erotic polarity is often discussed as “charge” created by complementary roles, but it is not limited to gender and can be fluid. Some people prefer strong polarity; others prefer symmetry and mutuality. Clarifying polarity preferences can reduce frustration and improve initiation, especially in long-term relationships where roles may drift.",A couple enjoys a clear initiator and a clear receiver role; Partners rotate roles to keep variety without losing the dynamic; Someone prefers equal initiation and feels turned off by rigid roles.,Identity & Attraction,Sensitive,"Polarity requires traditional gender roles; Polarity is the same as dominance/submission; Polarity means one partner is more important; If polarity is low, the relationship is doomed.",Power Orientation; Initiation & Communication Style; Sexual Script; Arousal Style; Relationship Satisfaction,erotic-polarity; attraction-dynamics; masculine-feminine-energy; role-balance; intimacy-chemistry; relationship-scripts
37,Ethical Constraints,Expectation & Norm,"Explicit rules and limits that ensure guidance and recommendations prioritize consent, privacy, and wellbeing over engagement or novelty.","Ethical constraints define what a system will not do (e.g., encourage coercion, violate confidentiality, or normalize harm). They protect users by shaping both scoring and language generation. In geo-distributed products, constraints should be consistent on core safety while allowing culturally sensitive phrasing and support pathways.",Preventing suggestions that pressure a partner; Requiring clear consent language for exploration content; Limiting how sensitive data is used in reports.,Consent & Boundaries,General,Ethical constraints are censorship; Constraints mean the product has a moral agenda; Constraints reduce user agency; Constraints guarantee that outputs are always correct and safe.,Non-Harm Principles; Gates / Guardrails; Consent Frameworks; Anonymization; Ethical Containment,ethical-constraints; consent-first; privacy-by-design; safety-standards; responsible-guidance
38,Ethical Containment,Practice & Skill,"A way of holding intense fantasies, impulses, or taboo curiosity within clear boundaries so exploration remains consensual, private, and non-harmful.","Ethical containment allows people to acknowledge desire without acting in ways that violate consent, agreements, or safety. It can involve fantasy-only exploration, role play with negotiated limits, or structured disclosure with aftercare. The goal is neither indulgence nor suppression-it is responsible integration.","Journaling or guided imagery instead of acting out a risky impulse; Negotiating a role-play scene with a safe word and limits; Choosing not to share a fantasy if it would pressure a partner, while still working with it privately.","Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Containment means repression and shame; If you contain a desire, it will disappear; Ethical containment justifies harmful urges; Containment removes the need for consent agreements.",Sexual Shadow; Fantasy vs Practice Distinction; Consent; Boundaries; Aftercare,ethical-containment; fantasy-management; kink-safety; boundaries; consent-first
39,Event-Based Reward,Framework & Model,"A reward pattern where motivation and satisfaction depend mainly on discrete outcomes such as orgasm, novelty, or ""success"" markers rather than the ongoing experience.","Event-based reward can be healthy (celebrating milestones) but can also create chasing and pressure when it becomes the only way satisfaction is measured. In intimacy, an overly event-focused reward style may increase performance anxiety and reduce curiosity. Balancing it with state-based reward often supports more sustainable pleasure and connection.","Only feeling sex ""counts"" if orgasm happens; Seeking constant novelty as the main driver of desire; Feeling disappointed despite connection because a goal wasn't achieved.",Desire & Arousal,General,"Event-based reward is childish; Orgasms don't matter at all; If you prefer events, you can't build long-term intimacy; Reward patterns are fixed and can't be rebalanced.","State-Based Reward; Performance Anxiety; Neurochemical ""Big Three"" (dopamine / oxytocin-vasopressin / endogenous opioids); Reward System Recalibration; Presence vs Performance",event-based-reward; orgasm-focus; novelty; motivation; desire-patterns
40,Evolutionary Hardware,Framework & Model,"The built-in biological systems shaped by evolution—such as hormones, reward circuits, and threat detection—that influence desire, attraction, and bonding.","Evolutionary hardware sets broad parameters (what feels rewarding, what feels risky), but it is not destiny. Health, sleep, stress, aging, and context can all change how the hardware expresses. Pairing this concept with psychological and social “software” avoids simplistic conclusions and supports individualized care.",Stress hormones suppress arousal even when attraction is present; Novelty cues quickly activate excitement for some people; Safety cues increase openness to touch and intimacy.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Evolutionary hardware proves everyone wants the same thing; If it’s biological, it can’t be changed; Hardware explanations justify harmful behavior; Culture has no influence on attraction.",Biochemical Reward Dynamics; Archaic Algorithms; Autonomic Nervous System (ANS); Desire; Arousal Accelerator,evolutionary-hardware; biology-of-desire; reward-system; threat-response; attraction; bonding
41,Evolutionary Mismatch,Framework & Model,"A concept describing how evolved human drives and attraction patterns can clash with modern environments, technology, and social expectations.","Evolutionary mismatch doesn’t mean people are “primitive”; it highlights that the conditions shaping desire (scarcity, small communities, slow feedback) differ from today’s high-stimulation world. In sexuality, mismatch can show up as attention pulled toward novelty, stress-related desire shifts, or confusion between safety cues and arousal cues. The framework is best used to generate compassion and better choices, not to excuse harmful behavior.",Feeling overstimulated by endless online novelty and struggling to stay present during partnered sex; Stress and sleep disruption reducing libido despite a strong relationship; Comparing your relationship to curated social media ideals and feeling dissatisfied.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Evolutionary mismatch proves humans can’t be monogamous; “Evolution” excuses cheating or coercion; If desire changes, the relationship is doomed; Mismatch is purely biological and ignores culture and learning.",Desire; Stress And Desire; Arousal Accelerator; Arousal Brake; Sexual Script,evolutionary-mismatch; modern-sexuality; desire-drivers; arousal-triggers; novelty; relationship-psychology
42,Fantasy vs Practice Distinction,Framework & Model,A clear separation between what feels arousing in imagination and what a person wants-or would be ethical-to do in real life.,"Many fantasies involve symbolism, novelty, or power dynamics that do not translate into real-world preferences. The distinction supports consent and reduces shame by allowing fantasy to be understood as imagination rather than intention. It is also helpful for safe disclosure: partners can share themes while agreeing on what stays in fantasy and what is negotiable in practice.","Enjoying a fantasy theme while having no desire to enact it; Sharing a fantasy as a story rather than a request; Agreeing that certain themes stay in imagination only, with clear boundaries.","Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Fantasies reveal what you secretly want to do; If something turns you on, you must try it; Sharing a fantasy is a demand; Fantasy-talk makes consent less important.",Ethical Containment; Sexual Shadow; Fantasy Comfort; Consent; Kink Disclosure,fantasy-vs-practice; fantasy-reality; kink-education; consent; shame-reduction
43,Feedback Loops,Pattern & Dynamic,"Self-reinforcing cycles where outcomes of behavior feed back into future behavior, strengthening either growth or problems over time.","Feedback loops explain why small patterns compound: avoidance can reduce confidence, which increases avoidance; good repair can build trust, which increases openness. In intimacy, loops can form around stress, rejection sensitivity, and reward expectations. Seeing the loop helps people choose small, consistent interventions that shift the trajectory.","Avoiding initiation reduces sexual confidence and makes initiation even less likely; Regular check-ins increase clarity, which reduces conflict and improves desire; Anxiety leads to rushed sex, which reduces satisfaction and increases anxiety.",Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,"Feedback loops mean nothing can change; A loop is the same as a personality trait; If a loop exists, the relationship is doomed; You can fix loops with a single big conversation.",Relational Loops; Longitudinal Check-ins; Sexual Confidence; Performance Anxiety; Reward System Recalibration,feedback-loops; relationship-systems; habit-change; positive-cycle; negative-cycle
44,Flow States,State & Experience,"A state of deep absorption where attention is fully engaged and self-consciousness decreases; in intimacy it can feel effortless, playful, and time-distorted.","Flow tends to emerge when there is enough safety, clear consent, and a good balance between comfort and stimulation. In sexuality, flow often looks like responsive pacing, mutual attunement, and reduced performance monitoring. People can support flow by reducing interruptions, creating privacy, and using communication that keeps both partners oriented to the present.",Losing track of time during connected intimacy; Feeling playful and spontaneous without overthinking; Noticing that privacy and emotional safety make it easier to stay absorbed.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Flow means intensity or orgasm must happen; Flow can be forced; If you don't reach flow, sex is failing; Flow is only for new relationships.",Optimal Sexual States; Presence vs Performance; State Optimization; Arousal Window; Emotional Safety,flow-states; sexual-flow; presence; absorption; arousal
45,Friction Points,Pattern & Dynamic,"Recurring situations where two people's needs, preferences, or expectations rub against each other and create tension in the relationship.","Friction points are not failures-they are negotiation zones. Common friction involves initiation style, frequency expectations, privacy needs, or different cultural scripts. Mapping friction points helps couples separate solvable logistics from deeper value conflicts and choose targeted experiments rather than repeating the same argument.","One partner wants spontaneous sex while the other needs planned time; Different definitions of ""quality time"" create conflict; A mismatch between direct vs indirect initiation leads to repeated misreads.",Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,"Friction means you're incompatible; Friction is always a sign of low love; The solution is to avoid the topic; Whoever cares less should ""win.""",Desire Discrepancy; Signal Mismatch; Initiation & Communication Style; Boundaries; Relationship Satisfaction,friction-points; relationship-conflict; negotiation; compatibility; communication
46,Gates / Guardrails,Framework & Model,"Hard or soft constraints in a system that prevent unsafe, incompatible, or non-consensual recommendations and keep results within ethical boundaries.","Guardrails can block matches when relationship form preferences conflict, when consent comfort is low, or when privacy rules require data minimization. They also help reduce harms from overconfident scoring by enforcing minimum thresholds and human-readable warnings. Good guardrails are transparent, culturally sensitive, and designed to protect users first.",Blocking recommendations that ignore a stated non-negotiable boundary; Requiring a minimum consent-comfort score before suggesting kink exploration content; Preventing sharing of identifiable data in public reports.,Consent & Boundaries,General,"Guardrails are censorship and always bad; If the model is accurate, guardrails are unnecessary; Guardrails remove user agency; Guardrails can replace consent and communication.",Consent; Boundaries; Anonymization; Pseudonymization; Compatibility Engine; Targeted Boosts,guardrails; safety-constraints; consent-first; ethical-ai; privacy; relationship-matching
47,Guided Self-Understanding,Practice & Skill,"A structured process of learning your own desires, boundaries, values, and arousal patterns using reflection, education, and safe communication.","Guided self-understanding can be solo (journaling, education) or relational (check-ins, therapy, coaching). It supports geo-diverse users by offering multiple culturally respectful pathways: private reflection, values-aligned language, and consent-centered negotiation rather than one “standard” intimacy script.",Using reflective prompts to name turn-ons and turn-offs; Learning your arousal brakes/accelerators and sharing them with a partner; Revisiting preferences over time with longitudinal check-ins.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Guidance means someone else defines your sexuality; Self-understanding should be instant; If you need guidance, you’re broken; Understanding removes the need for consent in the moment.",Reflective Prompts; Arousal Map; Consent Frameworks; Longitudinal Check-ins; Sexual Confidence,guided-self-understanding; sexual-self-knowledge; intimacy-education; relationship-communication; growth; global-access
48,Hardware–Software Consonance,State & Experience,"A mind–body alignment where biological readiness and learned beliefs/scripts support each other, making desire and intimacy feel easier and more natural.","Consonance can look like: your body feels safe, your mind feels permission, and your relationship context supports pacing and consent. It’s often built through reducing brakes (stress, shame), improving safety cues, and updating scripts via positive experience—not by forcing outcomes.",Feeling mentally open and physically responsive in the same context; Desire increases after shame scripts are addressed and sleep improves; A couple aligns expectations so initiation feels welcome and relaxed.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Consonance means you’ll always want sex; If you’re not aligned, the relationship is failing; Consonance can be achieved by “trying harder”; Consonance removes the need for consent check-ins.",Hardware–Software Framework; Cognitive Consonance; Cognitive and Somatic Dissonance; Arousal Brake,hardware-software-consonance; mind-body-alignment; arousal-support; sexual-wellbeing; consent-aware; relationship-context
49,Hardware–Software Framework,Framework & Model,"A model that separates biological “hardware” (body, brain, hormones, nervous system) from learned “software” (beliefs, scripts, experiences) to explain sexual functioning.","The framework helps people troubleshoot without blame: a desire issue might be hardware (sleep, medication, pain), software (shame, scripts), or both. It is also culturally flexible—software differs widely across countries, religions, and subcultures. Using the model encourages comprehensive solutions: medical care when needed plus communication and skill-building.",Low libido improves after addressing sleep and stress (hardware) and reducing shame (software); Arousal increases when partners change initiation habits and context; Someone notices medication affects response and adjusts with a clinician.,Desire & Arousal,General,"Sexuality is either biology or psychology, not both; “Hardware” problems mean the relationship is failing; “Software” problems can be solved with willpower alone; The model is a diagnostic label rather than a guide.",Evolutionary Hardware; Psychological Software; Social Software; Arousal Brake; Sexual Script,hardware-software-model; sexual-function; biopsychosocial; desire-and-arousal; sex-therapy-framework; wellbeing
50,Hardware–Software Mismatch,Pattern & Dynamic,"A situation where biological factors and learned beliefs/scripts pull in different directions, creating confusion or difficulty with desire, arousal, or intimacy.","Mismatch can be temporary (stress, medication) or long-standing (deep shame scripts, chronic pain). The value of the concept is reducing blame: instead of “I’m broken,” the question becomes “Which parts are hardware, which are software, and what support do they need?” It also encourages multi-path solutions—medical, psychological, relational, and cultural.",Strong attraction but low physical response due to fatigue or medication; Body is responsive but mind feels unsafe because of shame or past conditioning; Desire increases in fantasy but decreases in real-life context because of performance pressure.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,Mismatch means you are incompatible with your partner; It’s always caused by trauma; Hardware issues are purely medical and software issues are purely psychological; The mismatch proves your feelings aren’t real.,Hardware–Software Framework; Arousal Brake; Desire Discrepancy; Stress And Desire; Cognitive and Somatic Dissonance,hardware-software-mismatch; mind-body; arousal-difficulties; sexual-function; libido; relationship-context
51,Importance of Sexuality,Trait & Disposition,How central sex and sexual connection are to a person’s overall relationship satisfaction and sense of wellbeing.,"For some people, sexual connection is a primary bonding channel; for others, it is secondary to emotional intimacy, companionship, or shared goals. Importance can shift with health, aging, parenting, and life stress, and it is also shaped by culture and values. Naming this dimension helps couples negotiate frequency expectations without shaming either partner.",A person feels deeply connected through regular sexual intimacy; Someone values sex but is satisfied with lower frequency when affection and communication are strong; A couple renegotiates priorities after childbirth or major stress.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,"If sex is important to you, you are shallow; If sex is less important, you don’t love your partner; Importance equals desire level; Partners should have identical importance to be compatible.",Relationship Satisfaction; Sexual Needs; Sexual Frequency Expectations; Affection Gap; Emotional Intimacy,importance-of-sex; sexual-priorities; relationship-satisfaction; libido-compatibility; intimacy-needs; life-stages
52,Initiation & Communication Style,Trait & Disposition,"A person’s typical way of starting intimacy and talking about sexual needs, including how direct, playful, or cautious they tend to be.","Some people prefer explicit asking and clear consent language; others rely on subtle cues, flirting, or gradual escalation. Styles are shaped by culture, family norms, and past experiences, and mismatches can lead to confusion or resentment. Naming initiation and communication style helps couples create a shared “initiation protocol” that feels respectful and sexy.",One partner prefers direct verbal invites while the other prefers nonverbal touch-first initiation; A couple agrees on a simple check-in phrase to reduce awkwardness; Someone needs more emotional conversation before physical initiation feels welcome.,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,"Indirect initiation is always manipulative; Direct initiation ruins spontaneity; If initiation is awkward, attraction is missing; Communication style proves someone is experienced or inexperienced.",Turn-On Cues; Turn-Off Cues; Consent; Boundaries; Sexual Script; Signal Mismatch,initiation-style; sex-communication; consent-language; flirting; relationship-skills; global-intimacy
53,Interpretive Depth,Metric & Measurement,"The level of detail and nuance in how an assessment explains results, including context, uncertainty, and actionable next steps.","High interpretive depth goes beyond scores to include why a result was produced, what it means in real life, and how to discuss it with a partner. It may include multiple contributing dimensions, examples, and guardrail notes. Good depth improves trust across cultures by reducing jargon and showing how to use results responsibly.",A report explains top 3 factors driving a compatibility score; The system offers conversation prompts and boundary check-ins instead of only labels; Results include uncertainty notes and suggestions for revisiting answers over time.,Product & Assessment,General,More depth means the model is always right; Depth equals therapy; Users don’t need consent conversations if explanations are detailed; Interpretive depth should replace human judgment.,Alignment Profiles; Psychometric Scoring Layer; Validity; Reliability; Bias; Gates / Guardrails,interpretive-depth; explainable-assessments; user-insights; relationship-tools; transparency; responsible-ai
54,Item-Level Response Patterns,Data & Research Method,"Patterns found in how people answer individual survey items, including consistency, extremes, missingness, or changes across time or contexts.","Item-level patterns can improve measurement quality (detecting confusing items, translation issues, or response bias). They also raise privacy sensitivity because granular answers can be more identifying than aggregate scores—especially in small regions or niche subgroups—so access should be controlled and minimized.",Noticing one item produces unusually high “neutral” responses in one language; Detecting straight-lining (same answer for many items); Seeing missingness spike on a sensitive question and revising wording.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",Sensitive,Item-level data is harmless if names are removed; Item patterns prove someone is lying; More item tracking is always better; Item-level analysis replaces consent and transparency.,Likert-Scale Items; Bias; Reliability; Re-Identification Risk; Aggregation & Coarsening,item-level; response-patterns; survey-analytics; measurement-bias; privacy-risk; localization-qa
55,Likert-Scale Items,Metric & Measurement,"Survey questions that ask respondents to choose from ordered options (for example, from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”) to measure attitudes or traits.",Likert items are common in psychological and relationship research because they are easy to answer and analyze. They require careful translation and cultural adaptation so response meanings stay consistent across languages and regions. Good design also balances positive/negative wording to reduce response bias.,Rating agreement with “I feel comfortable discussing boundaries”; Choosing how often a statement feels true from “Never” to “Always”; Completing a multi-item scale for sexual self-efficacy.,Product & Assessment,General,Likert items measure objective facts; Everyone interprets the scale the same way; More response options always improves accuracy; Likert items eliminate social desirability bias.,Deep Survey; Soft Survey; Validity; Reliability; Bias; Psychometric Scoring Layer,likert-scale; survey-items; questionnaires; measurement; cross-cultural-research; response-bias
56,Limbic System,Data & Research Method,"A network of brain regions involved in emotion, motivation, memory, and threat/reward processing—core drivers of bonding and sexual response.","The limbic system helps assign meaning to touch, attraction cues, and relational safety. It can learn strong associations (positive or negative), which is why context and past experiences influence desire. While popular science sometimes oversimplifies limbic “wiring,” the key takeaway is that emotion and safety shape arousal.",Feeling more desire when emotionally connected and seen; A negative past experience creating a strong brake in similar contexts; Smell or music triggering memories that increase arousal.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,General,"The limbic system “controls” you completely; Emotional arousal and sexual arousal are always the same; If you understand the limbic system, you can override feelings instantly; Limbic responses are identical across all cultures and people.",Biochemical Reward Dynamics; Attachment Style; Arousal Accelerator; Arousal Brake; Emotional Intimacy,limbic-system; emotion-and-desire; bonding; reward-circuits; attachment; sexual-response
57,LLM Interpretation Layer,Framework & Model,"A system component that uses a large language model (LLM) to translate assessment signals into user-friendly explanations, insights, and suggested next steps.","An LLM interpretation layer sits on top of scores and structured inputs, turning them into clear narratives, examples, and reflective prompts. To stay reliable, it is usually constrained by curated knowledge, retrieval (RAG), and guardrails that prevent overconfident or unsafe claims. For geo-ready experiences, the layer should support localization, culturally respectful language, and plain terms instead of jargon.",Generating a readable summary of top drivers behind a score; Producing partner conversation prompts based on mismatched dimensions; Rephrasing guidance for different reading levels and regions.,Product & Assessment,General,The LLM is a therapist or clinician; The LLM always knows the truth behind your answers; LLM explanations are objective and free of bias; LLM text can replace consent conversations.,Interpretive Depth; Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); Curated Knowledge Base; Gates / Guardrails; Reflective Prompts,llm-interpretation; explainable-ai; assessment-insights; localization; user-guidance
58,Longitudinal Check-ins,Practice & Skill,"Repeat check-ins over time that track changes in desire, wellbeing, communication, or relationship satisfaction rather than relying on a single snapshot.","Longitudinal check-ins help people notice trends (stress seasons, recovery, growth) and reduce overreacting to one bad week. They support accountability without surveillance when participation is voluntary and privacy-respecting. For global use, check-ins should allow flexible schedules and culturally appropriate language for emotions, intimacy, and partnership roles.","Weekly ""how connected do we feel?"" check-in; Monthly review of boundaries, stress, and desired frequency; Tracking arousal brakes/accelerators across different life periods.",Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,"Check-ins are controlling or transactional; If you track it, it becomes unromantic; Check-ins automatically fix problems; Trends are meaningless because people change.",Feedback Loops; Relationship Satisfaction; Stress And Desire; Progressive Precision; Context-Sensitive Assessments,longitudinal-checkins; relationship-tracking; communication-habit; wellbeing-trends; couples-tools
59,Longitudinal Deltas,Metric & Measurement,Quantified changes in a person’s scores or dimensions over time (the “delta” between check-ins).,"Deltas help distinguish temporary states (stress season, life change) from stable traits. In global products, deltas should be interpreted with context (life stage, health, relationship events) and communicated carefully so users don’t treat normal fluctuation as failure.",Change in “sexual confidence” from last month; Shifts in arousal brakes during a high-stress period; Improvement in communication comfort after repeated check-ins.,Product & Assessment,General,Deltas prove the relationship is improving or failing; Any negative delta is bad; Deltas are comparable across users without context; Deltas remove the need for conversation.,Longitudinal Check-ins; Context-Sensitive Assessments; Interpretive Depth; Feedback Loops,longitudinal-deltas; change-over-time; progress-tracking; relationship-metrics; context-aware; wellbeing-trends
60,Motivation for Sexuality,Trait & Disposition,"The primary reasons someone seeks sexual connection, such as pleasure, bonding, stress relief, validation, novelty, or exploration.","Motivations are often layered and can shift across relationships and life stages. Differences in motivation can cause misunderstandings (for example, one partner seeks closeness while the other seeks relaxation). Naming motivations helps partners align expectations and choose activities that meet both people’s needs with consent and care.",One partner wants sex to feel emotionally close while the other wants stress relief; Someone seeks novelty and play as a way to feel alive; A couple uses sex to reconnect after conflict but agrees on aftercare.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"There is only one “healthy” motivation for sex; Wanting validation is always manipulative; Motivation should be obvious to partners; If motivations differ, sex will never work.",Emotional Intimacy; Validation Need; Stress And Desire; Aftercare; Desire; Sexual Needs,sexual-motivation; bonding; stress-relief; validation; intimacy-goals; libido-context
61,Neural Plasticity,Data & Research Method,"The brain’s capacity to change through learning and experience, allowing sexual response patterns, preferences, and emotional associations to evolve over time.","Plasticity is why education, new relational experiences, and therapy can shift desire and reduce old brakes, though change often requires repetition and safety. It also explains why repeated exposure to certain cues (including media) can shape arousal templates. The concept supports a growth mindset without blaming people for having learned patterns in the first place.",A couple builds new positive associations by slowing down and communicating what feels good; Someone’s arousal patterns shift after a major life transition; Practicing consent check-ins makes intimacy feel safer and more enjoyable.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Plasticity means you can force yourself to like anything; If patterns can change, boundaries don’t matter; Change should be quick if you “try hard”; Plasticity is the same as willpower.",Psychological Software; Somatic Integration; Desire Cues; Arousal Map; Stress And Desire,neural-plasticity; learning-and-desire; conditioned-arousal; sexual-growth; habit-change; intimacy-skills
62,Neurochemical “Big Three” (dopamine / oxytocin-vasopressin / endogenous opioids),Framework & Model,"A shorthand for three neurochemical systems often linked to sexual motivation and reward (dopamine), bonding and attachment (oxytocin/vasopressin), and pleasure/comfort (endogenous opioids).","These systems interact: novelty can boost dopamine, closeness can strengthen bonding signals, and soothing touch can support comfort and satisfaction. Popular media can exaggerate simple “chemical” explanations, so it’s best used as a lens rather than a diagnosis. Culture and relationship meaning strongly shape how these reward signals are experienced and interpreted.","Anticipation and flirting increasing motivation and excitement; Cuddling and affectionate reassurance deepening a sense of bonding; Feeling calm, satisfied, and connected after pleasurable intimacy.",Desire & Arousal,General,Sex is “just chemicals” and love is an illusion; Dopamine means you need constant novelty; Oxytocin guarantees trust or monogamy; Neurochemicals determine compatibility without communication.,Biochemical Reward Dynamics; Limbic System; Attachment Style; Desire; Aftercare,sexual-neurochemistry; dopamine; oxytocin; endogenous-opioids; bonding; pleasure
63,Non-Harm Principles,Expectation & Norm,"Safety-first principles that guide advice and product behavior toward reducing risk, preventing coercion, and supporting user wellbeing.","Non-harm principles often include: prioritize consent, avoid shame, avoid medical or legal overreach, and encourage seeking qualified support when needed. They act as a compass when data is uncertain or culturally sensitive. In relationship contexts, non-harm means respecting autonomy and avoiding ""one right way"" prescriptions.","Using neutral, non-shaming language when discussing desire changes; Recommending pause-and-check-in when someone feels unsure; Suggesting professional support when pain or trauma symptoms are present.",Consent & Boundaries,General,Non-harm means never taking any emotional risk; Non-harm is the same as avoiding all discomfort; Non-harm principles replace boundaries and consent; Non-harm is only relevant for clinical therapy.,Ethical Constraints; Gates / Guardrails; Consent; Emotional Safety; Aftercare,non-harm; do-no-harm; consent-safety; trauma-informed; wellbeing
64,Normalized Dimension Values,Metric & Measurement,Dimension scores that have been scaled to a common range so different traits or needs can be compared or combined more fairly.,"Normalization can be done by min–max scaling, z-scores, or other transformations depending on the product goal. It helps prevent a single dimension from dominating because of raw scale differences. Clear documentation matters because “normalized” values can be misread as absolute truths rather than standardized estimates.",Scaling multiple scores to 0–1 before computing a compatibility summary; Using z-scores so regional norms don’t distort comparisons; Adjusting scores so a 1–5 item scale aligns with a 0–100 report format.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Normalized means perfect and unbiased; Normalized scores are the same as clinical diagnoses; Higher normalized values are always better; Normalization removes the need for cultural calibration.,Validity; Reliability; Bias; Dimension Weights; Similarity-Based Scoring; Satisfaction Baseline,normalized-scores; feature-scaling; psychometrics; measurement; compatibility-metrics; global-calibration
65,Onionlayer Model,Framework & Model,"A layered way of describing sexuality where outward behaviors sit on top of deeper layers like meaning, emotions, attachment needs, and nervous-system states.","The Onionlayer Model is useful for moving beyond “technique” and asking what a sexual preference is doing emotionally (connection, validation, play, power, safety). Different cultures emphasize different layers (duty, romance, spirituality, pleasure), so the model helps compare without judging. It can also guide conversations: start with safety and meaning before negotiating behaviors.",A partner asks for more sex but the deeper layer is wanting reassurance and closeness; A person thinks they want novelty but realizes they mainly want playfulness and permission; Conflict decreases arousal because the safety layer isn’t met.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,"The model says deeper motives are always “the real reason”; If you understand the layers, sex problems disappear; Only therapists can use layered models; Layers are the same for everyone.",Emotional Intimacy; Attachment Style; Desire; Arousal Brake; Relationship Form Preference,onionlayer-model; layered-sexuality; intimacy-needs; meaning-and-arousal; relationship-communication; attachment
66,Opt-In Consent,Expectation & Norm,A consent approach where users actively choose to participate (or share data) rather than being included by default.,"Opt-in consent supports autonomy and trust, especially for sensitive topics. In product and research contexts, it works best when it’s informed (plain language), specific (clear purpose), reversible (easy withdrawal), and paired with minimal data collection and transparent governance.",A checkbox to share anonymized data for research; Separate consent for personalized insights vs research use; A clear “withdraw consent” option in settings.,Consent & Boundaries,General,"Opt-in means consent is permanent; If users opt in, any use is acceptable; Opt-in guarantees understanding; Opt-in is only a legal requirement, not an ethical practice.",Consent Frameworks; Ethical Constraints; Tiered Access Approach; Non-Harm Principles,opt-in-consent; informed-consent; user-control; privacy-choice; transparent-data-use; global-trust
67,Optimal Sexual States,State & Experience,"Personal conditions of safety, presence, and responsive arousal where intimacy feels most connected, consensual, and pleasurable.","Optimal sexual states are not a single ""peak"" experience; they vary by person and relationship. Common ingredients include emotional safety, adequate time, privacy, and attuned pacing. Tracking what supports these states helps couples design contexts that feel good across life stages and cultures, without treating any one style of sex as the standard.","Feeling relaxed, unhurried, and emotionally connected; Enjoying touch most when there is privacy and playful communication; Noticing arousal is easier after repair and reassurance.",Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"There is one universal optimal state; If you don't reach it, something is wrong; Optimal states should happen every time; Chasing optimal states matters more than consent or comfort.",Arousal Window; Flow States; State Optimization; Emotional Safety; Aftercare,optimal-sexual-states; sexual-wellbeing; arousal-window; connection; presence
68,Pattern Libraries (by Modality),Product Artifact,"A structured collection of relationship and sexuality patterns, exercises, and prompts organized by modalities such as sensory, emotional, communication, fantasy, and novelty.","Pattern libraries turn abstract concepts into practical options users can try. Organizing by modality supports personalization: people can explore what works for their arousal style, values, and comfort level. For global use, libraries should include culturally flexible language and multiple paths (e.g., verbal vs nonverbal communication) without stereotyping.","A ""sensory"" library of touch and pacing experiments; A ""communication"" library of consent check-ins and repair scripts; A ""fantasy"" library of safe sharing prompts and boundaries.",Product & Assessment,Sensitive,"Pattern libraries are stereotypes about people; If a pattern is suggested, you should do it; Libraries replace consent and negotiation; The same patterns work in every culture and relationship.",Core Modalities; Reflective Prompts; Consent Frameworks; Arousal Style; Ethical Constraints,pattern-library; modalities; intimacy-exercises; consent-prompts; personalized-growth
69,Performance Anxiety,State & Experience,"Anxiety about being evaluated or ""doing it right"" in sexual situations, which can activate inhibition and reduce pleasure, arousal, or connection.","Performance anxiety often comes from sexual scripts, past criticism, body image pressure, and outcome-focused expectations. It can affect anyone, regardless of gender or experience.

70,Polyvagal Theory,Framework & Model,"A theory describing how the nervous system shifts between states of safety, mobilization, and shutdown, influencing connection, communication, and sexual readiness.","Polyvagal theory is widely used in somatic and trauma-informed practice to explain why people can feel open and connected in one moment and distant or numb in another. In intimacy, cues of safety (tone of voice, pacing, consent, privacy) can help move toward a “social engagement” state. The theory is influential, though researchers debate some details; its practical value is often in helping people name state shifts with less shame.",A partner’s gentle voice and slower pace helps someone relax into touch; Feeling judged triggers shutdown and emotional distance; Taking a break and reconnecting through eye contact and breathing before continuing.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,"Polyvagal theory is a complete map of the brain; If someone is dysregulated, they are choosing to be difficult; Nervous-system states remove responsibility for behavior; The theory means sex should always be soothing and never activating.",Autonomic Nervous System (ANS); Vagus Nerve; Emotional Safety; Aftercare; Somatic Integration,polyvagal-theory; nervous-system-states; co-regulation; emotional-safety; intimacy; stress-and-desire
71,Power Orientation,Trait & Disposition,"A person’s preference for power dynamics in intimacy, such as enjoying equality, taking the lead, yielding control, or switching roles.","Power orientation can be expressed in non-sexual relationship roles (decision-making, planning) and in erotic contexts (dominance/submission themes). It is healthiest when it is consensual, explicit, and aligned with boundaries. Power preferences can be cultural and contextual, and they may change depending on safety, trust, and stress levels.",Someone feels most turned on when they lead and their partner enjoys being guided; A person prefers egalitarian decision-making but likes playful dominance in the bedroom; A couple uses clear consent language when experimenting with control dynamics.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Power orientation means someone wants control in everyday life; Interest in power play equals aggression; Power dynamics eliminate the need for consent; If partners differ, it is unsafe to discuss.",Role Play; Roleplay Boundaries; Consent; Safe Word; Erotic Polarity; Typical Sexual Fantasies,power-orientation; dominance-submission; power-play; kink-consent; role-dynamics; erotic-compatibility
72,Practical Wisdom Traditions,Framework & Model,"Ethical and contemplative traditions that emphasize skillful living-applied to relationships through compassion, integrity, presence, and self-knowledge.","Practical wisdom traditions include diverse sources (philosophy, mindfulness, religious and secular ethics, community teachings) that offer tools for regulating emotion, repairing harm, and clarifying values. In sexuality and intimacy, they can support non-shaming reflection and consent-centered behavior. For global audiences, it helps to present traditions inclusively and avoid claiming any single worldview is superior.",Using mindfulness to reduce reactivity during conflict; Applying values clarification to relationship agreements; Practicing compassion-based repair after misunderstandings.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,Wisdom traditions are anti-sex; Spiritual ideas can replace consent; One tradition fits everyone; Wisdom language is the same as avoiding real problems.,Non-Harm Principles; Ethical Constraints; State Optimization; Spiritual Sexuality; Reflective Prompts,practical-wisdom; relationship-ethics; mindfulness; values-clarity; global-culture
73,Presence vs Performance,Pattern & Dynamic,"A common tension in intimacy between being present and attuned versus focusing on doing it ""right,"" meeting expectations, or achieving outcomes.","Performance focus often activates arousal brakes (self-monitoring, fear of judgment) and reduces pleasure. Presence emphasizes attention to sensation, connection, and consent in the moment. The distinction is useful for couples across cultures because it reframes many ""technique"" problems as attention and safety problems.","Worrying about orgasm and losing arousal; Feeling more pleasure when attention stays on breath and touch; Shifting from ""am I good enough?"" to ""what feels good right now?""",Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Performance is always bad and goals are never okay; Presence means ignoring your partner's experience; If you struggle with presence, you are sexually incompatible; Presence will fix all sexual issues instantly.",Performance Anxiety; Embodied Integration; Sexual Confidence; Arousal Brake; Flow States,presence-vs-performance; sexual-anxiety; mindfulness; pleasure; connection
74,Progressive Precision,Framework & Model,"An assessment approach that starts with broad, low-friction questions and gradually increases specificity as trust, clarity, and context build.","Progressive precision reduces overwhelm and improves accuracy by letting users begin with simple signals, then drilling down only where it matters. It is especially useful across cultures and languages, where people may need more time to interpret terms or feel safe answering sensitive topics. The method often pairs with interpretive depth to explain why follow-up questions are being asked.","Starting with a short onboarding survey, then offering optional deep-dive modules; Asking follow-up questions only when a dimension score is ambiguous; Using gentle language first, then more specific examples as the user opts in.",Product & Assessment,General,More questions always means better truth; Progressive precision is the same as being vague; Precision means you can predict relationship outcomes; Users must answer everything for results to be useful.,Soft Survey; Deep Survey; Context-Sensitive Assessments; Interpretive Depth; Longitudinal Check-ins,progressive-precision; adaptive-assessment; onboarding; survey-design; user-trust
75,Psychological Software,Framework & Model,"Learned mental patterns—beliefs, expectations, associations, and memories—that shape how a person experiences desire, arousal, and intimacy.","Psychological software includes sexual scripts, body beliefs, relational expectations, and conditioned turn-ons/turn-offs. It can be updated through new experiences, therapy, education, and supportive relationships, though change is often gradual. This concept helps people look for leverage points beyond “more effort,” such as reducing shame, building safety, and practicing communication.",Someone’s arousal drops when they feel judged because of past criticism; A person learns to enjoy slower touch after practicing mindfulness and requesting pacing; New positive experiences rewrite associations with intimacy after a difficult period.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,General,"Psychological software is “all in your head” and not real; You can change it instantly with positive thinking; If you have negative scripts, you’re incompatible with partners; Software change means ignoring boundaries or discomfort.",Sexual Script; Attachment Style; Arousal Brake; Emotional Safety; Desire Cues,psychological-software; sexual-scripts; conditioned-arousal; attachment-patterns; sexual-confidence; intimacy
76,Psychometric Infrastructure,Product Artifact,"The tools, processes, and standards used to design surveys, score dimensions, test reliability/validity, and maintain measurement quality over time.","This includes item banks, translation workflows, calibration studies, version control, and monitoring for drift or bias.

It aims to produce stable, interpretable outputs while minimizing bias and noise. In practice, transparent scoring improves trust and makes results easier to explain to users in different countries and cultures.",Converting multiple questions into a single “sexual confidence” score; Checking reliability before using a scale in a new language; Using normalization so different dimensions can be compared fairly.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,"Scoring is objective and cannot be biased; More complex scoring is always better; Psychometrics replaces human judgment and conversation; If an item is on a survey, it must be accurate.",Validity; Reliability; Bias; Normalized Dimension Values; Likert-Scale Items; Deep Survey,psychometric-scoring; measurement-model; survey-scales; reliability-validity; assessment-design; bias-reduction
78,Quasi-Identifiers,Data & Research Method,"Data fields that don’t identify someone alone but can identify them when combined (e.g., age, city, job title, rare attributes).","Quasi-identifiers are a major driver of re-identification, especially in small populations, small countries/regions, or niche communities. Good governance uses aggregation, coarsening, suppression, and access tiering to reduce risk while preserving research value.","“Age 47, small town, niche profession” uniquely identifies someone; Combining region + uncommon preference flags a person; Removing exact dates and using age ranges reduces risk.","Data, Privacy & Measurement",Sensitive,"Quasi-identifiers are harmless because they aren’t names; If data is aggregated, risk is always gone; Only celebrities can be re-identified; Quasi-identifiers don’t matter if the dataset is “internal.”",Direct Identifiers; Aggregation & Coarsening; Suppression of Rare Combinations; Re-Identification Risk,quasi-identifiers; indirect-identifiers; k-anonymity; privacy-risk; small-populations; data-protection
79,Re-Identification Risk,Metric & Measurement,"The likelihood that a person can be identified from a dataset, directly or indirectly, through linking or inference.","Risk depends on data granularity, uniqueness, available external data, and who has access. It’s dynamic: what’s safe today may be less safe tomorrow as external datasets grow. Strong programs measure and reduce risk using coarsening, suppression, tiered access, and controlled environments.",Linking region + age + rare traits identifies someone; A researcher matches anonymized records to public data; Risk drops after moving from city-level to country-level reporting.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Anonymized data has no re-identification risk; Risk only matters if someone has bad intentions; Re-identification is impossible without direct identifiers; Risk assessment is one-time and done.,Quasi-Identifiers; Aggregation & Coarsening; Controlled Research Environments; Ethical Constraints,reidentification-risk; privacy-risk; disclosure-risk; data-linkage; gdpr-aligned; governance
80,Reflective Prompts,Practice & Skill,"Short questions or exercises designed to support self-awareness, safer communication, and intentional choices in relationships and sexuality.","Reflective prompts turn insight into action by helping people name needs, fears, turn-ons, and boundaries in approachable language. They can be used solo or with partners and are most effective when they invite curiosity rather than pressure. In geo-diverse settings, prompts should avoid slang, respect values, and offer multiple ways to answer (words, ratings, or examples).","What would make tonight feel safer or more relaxed?; ""What's one thing that helped you feel desired this week?""; ""Is there anything you want to slow down or stop today?""",Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,Prompts are manipulation; Prompts replace real conversation; Good relationships don't need prompts; Prompts should push people past discomfort to be effective.,Interpretive Depth; Consent Frameworks; Aftercare; Communication Patterns; Embodied Integration,reflective-prompts; conversation-starters; consent-checkins; self-awareness; relationship-skills
81,Relational Loops,Pattern & Dynamic,"Repeating interaction cycles that reinforce closeness or conflict, often without either person consciously choosing the pattern.","Relational loops can be positive (repair, reassurance, playful pursuit) or negative (pursue-withdraw, criticize-defend). They are shaped by attachment needs, stress, and communication habits. Naming the loop helps partners shift from blame (""you are the problem"") to pattern thinking (""we're stuck in a cycle"").","One partner pursues closeness, the other withdraws, which increases pursuit; After conflict, partners avoid sex, which increases distance and more conflict; Quick repair conversations create a loop of safety and reconnection.",Emotional & Attachment Patterns,Sensitive,"A relational loop proves someone is toxic; Loops can't change; The loop is one partner's fault; If you can name the loop once, it disappears.",Feedback Loops; Attachment Style; Emotional Safety; Rejection Sensitivity; Relational Attunement,relational-loops; pursue-withdraw; attachment-patterns; cycle-breaking; couples-dynamics
82,Relationship Form Preference,Need & Preference,"A person’s preferred relationship structure, such as monogamy, non-monogamy, or other commitment styles, based on needs and values.","Relationship form preference is about what feels sustainable and meaningful—not a moral ranking. Preferences can be influenced by culture, religion, community norms, and personal history, and they can also evolve across life stages. Clear communication about expectations (exclusivity, openness, emotional commitment) reduces conflict and supports informed consent in relationship agreements.",A person prefers monogamy with clear exclusivity; Someone prefers consensual non-monogamy with negotiated boundaries; A couple chooses a flexible arrangement during long-distance periods.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,Sensitive,"Preference equals identity and can never change; Non-monogamy means commitment is impossible; Monogamy is always the healthiest option; If partners differ, the relationship must end immediately.",Sexual Script; Boundaries; Consent; Autonomy Need; Relationship Satisfaction; Cultural Mismatch,relationship-form-preference; monogamy; nonmonogamy; relationship-agreements; cross-cultural-relationships; commitment-styles
83,Research-Grade Dataset,Product Artifact,"A curated dataset prepared for high-quality analysis, typically with documentation, validation checks, and clear definitions for variables and scales.","Research-grade datasets emphasize consistency, provenance, and interpretability: codebooks, versioning, missing-data rules, and validation of psychometric measures.

85,Reward System Recalibration,Practice & Skill,A process of adjusting reward expectations and cue-reactivity so desire and satisfaction rely less on high-intensity novelty and more on sustainable pleasure and connection.,"Recalibration can involve changing inputs (stress, sleep, digital habits), widening what feels rewarding (state-based rewards), and practicing presence and communication. It is not a moral judgment; it is a learning process supported by neural plasticity. In global contexts, recalibration should respect cultural values and avoid shaming language.",Reducing overstimulation so partnered touch feels more rewarding; Rebuilding pleasure after burnout by focusing on safety and slow arousal; Shifting from orgasm-only goals to broader connection and sensation.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Recalibration means quitting sex or desire; It is only about porn; You can reset your reward system instantly; If you need recalibration, you are broken.",Neural Plasticity; Event-Based Reward; State-Based Reward; Presence vs Performance; Evolutionary Mismatch,reward-recalibration; dopamine-balance; sustainable-pleasure; habit-change; libido-health
86,Risk Orientation,Trait & Disposition,"A person’s tendency to prefer more or less risk in dating, intimacy, and sexual exploration, including comfort with uncertainty and novelty.","Risk orientation influences how quickly someone escalates intimacy, experiments with new activities, or shares vulnerable information. It can be shaped by personality, culture, past experiences, and safety cues in a relationship. Couples often do best when they can negotiate pace differences without shaming either the cautious or adventurous partner.",One partner wants to try new experiences early while the other prefers gradual steps; Someone prefers very clear agreements before intimacy; A person enjoys spontaneous plans but needs strong privacy and safety boundaries.,Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,High risk orientation means someone is irresponsible; Low risk orientation means someone is prudish; Risk orientation is fixed and cannot change; Risk orientation is the same as consent willingness.,Boundaries; Consent; Curiosity & Exploration Orientation; Taboo Curiosity; Routine Comfort; Arousal Brake,risk-orientation; intimacy-pacing; novelty-vs-safety; relationship-negotiation; global-dating; consent-boundaries
87,Sexual Architecture,Framework & Model,"A structured view of sexuality that maps how biology, learning, emotions, values, and context interact to shape desire, arousal, and intimacy choices.","This “architecture” framing helps people troubleshoot without blame: a challenge might be hardware (sleep, pain), software (scripts, shame), relational (trust, conflict), or cultural (norms, taboo). It supports clearer, geo-friendly education because it’s adaptable across cultures and life stages while keeping consent and wellbeing central.","Identifying that stress (state) is the main brake, not attraction; Separating cultural scripts from personal preferences; Designing context changes (privacy, pacing) to support arousal.",Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"Having a model means you can predict everything; Sexual architecture is the same for everyone; Biology overrides values and consent; If you map it, you can “fix” a partner.",Hardware–Software Framework; Dual Control Model of Sexual Response; Social Software; Psychological Software,sexual-architecture; biopsychosocial; desire-model; arousal-context; sexual-wellbeing; cross-cultural
88,Sexual Confidence,Trait & Disposition,"A person’s sense of comfort, capability, and self-trust in sexual situations, including communicating needs and receiving feedback.","Sexual confidence is not the same as experience; it often grows through safety, positive communication, and body acceptance. Low confidence can be linked to performance anxiety, shame scripts, or negative experiences, and it can improve with education and supportive partners. Healthy confidence includes the ability to say no, ask for what you want, and tolerate learning curves.",Someone asks for slower touch without apologizing; A person feels comfortable discussing turn-ons and boundaries; Confidence improves after learning anatomy and consent skills.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,Confidence means you never feel nervous; Confident people always want sex; Confidence is fixed and you either have it or you don’t; Confidence equals being “good in bed.”,Sexual Self-Efficacy; Body Image Impact; Consent; Turn-On Cues; Arousal Brake,sexual-confidence; sexual-self-esteem; performance-anxiety; sex-communication; pleasure-skills; body-acceptance
89,Sexual Diversity,Identity & Orientation,"The recognition that human sexuality varies widely across orientations, identities, bodies, desires, and relationship styles, without treating difference as dysfunction.","Sexual diversity includes differences in attraction patterns, arousal styles, gender identities, relationship forms, and levels of sexual interest. A diversity lens reduces stigma and supports culturally respectful care by avoiding one-size-fits-all norms. In practice, it emphasizes consent, autonomy, and accurate information over moral judgment.",Recognizing asexuality as a valid orientation; Respecting different relationship forms when consensual; Normalizing that arousal triggers vary by person and life stage.,Identity & Attraction,Sensitive,"Diversity means anything goes without consent; Sexual diversity is a trend or ideology, not real; Differences must be ""fixed"" to be healthy; Diversity means partners should tolerate boundary violations.",Identity & Orientation; Relationship Form Preference; Arousal Style; Sexual Script; Consent,sexual-diversity; orientation-spectrum; inclusive-sex-ed; stigma-reduction; global-wellbeing
90,Sexual Excitation System (SES),Framework & Model,"The part of the Dual Control Model describing the mechanisms that increase sexual arousal in response to stimulating cues, context, and meaning.","SES includes what a person’s brain and body interpret as “erotic accelerators,” such as novelty, attraction, safety, or specific fantasies. Excitation is highly individual and can shift with stress, relationship dynamics, and culture. Understanding your SES supports better communication about what helps you get in the mood.",A person becomes more aroused with playful flirting and anticipation; Erotic stories or visual novelty increase arousal; Feeling emotionally connected and safe makes touch feel more exciting.,Desire & Arousal,General,"High SES means you’re “hypersexual”; SES is the same as sexual desire in all contexts; If your partner’s SES differs, you are incompatible; SES is fixed and cannot change.",Dual Control Model of Sexual Response; Arousal Accelerator; Arousal Map; Responsive Arousal; Desire Cues,sexual-excitation-system; ses; dual-control-model; arousal-accelerators; desire-cues; sexual-response
91,Sexual Inhibition System (SIS),Framework & Model,"The part of the Dual Control Model describing the mechanisms that reduce sexual arousal when the brain detects risk, discomfort, or lack of safety.","SIS reflects “erotic brakes,” such as worry about performance, fear of judgment, feeling unsafe, or practical concerns (privacy, time, stress). Inhibition can be protective, and high inhibition does not mean low attraction. Identifying specific brakes helps partners design contexts that support comfort and consent.",A person loses arousal when they feel rushed or overheard; Stress about body image makes it hard to stay present; Conflict earlier in the day makes touch feel less welcome.,Desire & Arousal,General,"If you have a strong SIS, you don’t love your partner; Inhibition is purely psychological and can be “willed away”; SIS is always bad and should be removed; Arousal problems are only about attraction, not brakes.",Dual Control Model of Sexual Response; Arousal Brake; Consent; Arousal Window; Emotional Safety,sexual-inhibition-system; sis; dual-control-model; arousal-brakes; sexual-anxiety; safety-cues
92,Sexual Self-Actualization,State & Experience,"A growth-oriented state where a person’s sexuality is integrated with their values, boundaries, self-knowledge, and consent-centered relationships.","Self-actualization in sexuality doesn’t mean constant desire or perfect performance; it means clarity, integrity, and the ability to pursue pleasure and connection in ways that are safe and aligned.

93,Sexual Shadow,State & Experience,"The set of sexual desires, fantasies, or impulses a person disowns, suppresses, or judges—often because they conflict with identity, values, or social norms.","Sexual shadow work is about bringing curiosity and compassion to hidden or “unacceptable” parts of desire without acting them out in harmful ways. For many people, the shadow contains taboo themes, power fantasies, or contradictions that feel scary to name. Exploring it safely can reduce shame, improve consent clarity, and support healthier erotic self-knowledge.",Someone feels aroused by a fantasy but worries it says something “bad” about them; A person hides interest in kink from partners out of fear of judgment; Feeling attracted to a type of dynamic you don’t want in real life and learning to separate fantasy from action.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,Your fantasies reveal your real-world intentions; Having a sexual shadow means you are unsafe; Shadow exploration requires acting out taboo fantasies; The shadow disappears once you talk about it once.,Fantasy; Kink Curiosity; Fantasy Comfort; Fantasy Boundaries; Consent,sexual-shadow; erotic-fantasy; kink-psychology; sexual-shame; fantasy-vs-reality; self-acceptance
94,Sexual Signature,Trait & Disposition,"An individual’s characteristic pattern of arousal triggers, turn-ons/turn-offs, emotional needs, and preferred dynamics that tends to repeat across relationships and contexts.","A sexual signature can include sensory preferences (touch, pace), psychological themes (novelty, reassurance), and relational conditions (safety, privacy). It’s not fixed—plasticity and life stages can shift it—but it often has recognizable “core notes.” Clarifying your signature supports healthier communication and reduces mismatched expectations.",Someone needs emotional closeness before physical desire kicks in; A person is reliably turned on by playful teasing and anticipation; Privacy and time are essential conditions for arousal to build.,Desire & Arousal,Sensitive,"A sexual signature is your sexual identity; If your signature differs from a partner’s, you can’t have a good sex life; Your signature should stay the same over time; Knowing your signature removes the need for consent check-ins.",Arousal Map; Desire Cues; Responsive Desire; Spontaneous Desire; Arousal Window,sexual-signature; arousal-patterns; turn-ons; libido-style; relationship-communication; sexual-self-knowledge
95,Sexual Tabooization,Expectation & Norm,"The social process of marking sex, desire, or sexual topics as “unmentionable,” shameful, or inappropriate, making open learning and communication harder.","Tabooization can be subtle (avoiding words, jokes, or questions) or explicit (punishment, censorship, moral condemnation). It often increases misinformation and anxiety by pushing curiosity underground, and it can differ widely across regions, generations, and subcultures. Reducing taboo doesn’t mean removing values—it means making space for respectful, accurate conversations about consent, health, and pleasure.",A family that treats all sexual questions as disrespectful; Someone avoiding medical care because talking about sex feels embarrassing; Partners never discussing turn-ons or boundaries because it feels “awkward” or “dirty.”,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"Tabooization is the same as having personal boundaries; Talking about sex openly automatically leads to risky behavior; Only religious communities have sexual taboos; If sex is taboo in your culture, communication is impossible.",Sexual Script; Fantasy Disclosure; Kink Disclosure; Consent; Boundaries,sexual-taboos; sexual-shame; sex-communication; cultural-norms; pleasure-literacy; stigma
96,Signal Mismatch,Pattern & Dynamic,"A breakdown where one person’s sexual or relational signals are interpreted differently by another person, leading to confusion about interest, consent, or pacing.","Signal mismatch often happens when partners have different cultural scripts, different initiation styles, or different assumptions about what counts as “yes,” “maybe,” or “not now.” It can also appear in digital communication where tone is missing. Reducing mismatch usually involves explicit check-ins, clearer consent language, and naming preferred cues.",Playful teasing is read as rejection; A partner thinks silence means consent while the other needs a clear verbal yes; Text messages feel cold to one partner and neutral to the other.,Sexual Communication & Initiation,Sensitive,"Signal mismatch means someone is intentionally misleading; If signals are unclear, you should push harder; Miscommunication only happens in new relationships; Consent can be assumed if there is attraction.",Consent; Boundaries; Turn-On Cues; Turn-Off Cues; Cultural Mismatch; Initiation & Communication Style,signal-mismatch; miscommunication; consent-checkin; sexual-cues; relationship-clarity; cross-cultural
97,Similarity-Based Scoring,Data & Research Method,A scoring method that estimates how close two profiles are (person–person or person–prototype) using similarity or distance measures.,"Similarity scoring often uses cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or related metrics on normalized vectors. The method is useful for ranking matches and generating explanations like “you overlap on communication and boundaries.” It should be paired with uncertainty reporting and guardrails so users don’t over-trust a single number.",Ranking potential matches by shared values and intimacy pacing; Matching users to archetype prototypes using vector similarity; Explaining a high score by highlighting top shared dimensions.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,"A single similarity score guarantees relationship success; Similarity is always better than complementarity; Similarity scoring is neutral and cannot encode bias; If similarity is low, communication is pointless.",Dimension Vector (Coordinate Vector); Normalized Dimension Values; Dimension Weights; Compatibility Engine; Validity,similarity-scoring; matching-score; cosine-similarity; distance-metrics; compatibility-algorithm; explainable-ai
98,Social Software,Expectation & Norm,"The social rules, norms, and roles a person learns about dating, gender, commitment, and sexuality, which shape what feels “allowed” or “expected.”","Social software differs across countries, communities, and generations and can create pressure or confusion when partners run different “operating systems.” It influences consent language, initiation patterns, and assumptions about exclusivity and pleasure. Making social software explicit reduces misunderstanding and supports respectful negotiation.","One partner expects indirect initiation while the other prefers explicit asking; A couple assumes different meanings of “being serious” based on social norms; Someone feels they must perform a role (e.g., always initiating) even when it doesn’t feel authentic.",Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,"Social software is the same as personal values; If norms are “traditional,” they’re always harmful or always right; Partners should automatically know each other’s social expectations; Social software can’t change.",Sexual Script; Relationship Form Preference; Boundary Setting; Consent; Desire Discrepancy,social-software; relationship-norms; dating-scripts; consent-culture; communication-styles; cultural-variation
99,Softmax Normalization,Data & Research Method,"A mathematical transformation that converts a set of raw scores into probabilities that sum to 1, often used to model “likelihood” across multiple archetypes or options.","Softmax emphasizes relative differences: the highest score becomes the most likely outcome, but all options receive some probability unless gated. Temperature or sharpness parameters can make the distribution more decisive or more spread out. For user-facing products, explainability matters because probabilities can feel overly certain.",Converting archetype match scores into a ranked probability list; Making results more or less decisive by adjusting a sharpness parameter; Presenting top 3 archetypes with probabilities plus confidence notes.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Softmax outputs are absolute truth; Probabilities are the same as guarantees; Softmax removes bias; The highest probability means no other option fits.,Archetype Probability Distribution; Distribution “Sharpness”; Similarity-Based Scoring; Normalized Dimension Values,softmax; probability-normalization; machine-learning; archetype-matching; confidence; explainable-results
100,Somatic Integration,Practice & Skill,"A skill of noticing body sensations and using them to align choices, consent, and intimacy with what feels safe, present, and responsive.","Somatic integration bridges cognition and sensation: people learn to track breathing, tension, warmth, and emotional shifts while communicating needs. It can improve pleasure and reduce overwhelm by helping partners slow down, adjust pacing, and stay connected. The practice is adaptable across cultures because it focuses on internal signals rather than any single sexual “right way.”",Pausing during intimacy to check body tension and ask for slower touch; Using breathing and grounding to stay present when anxious; Noticing numbness and choosing to stop or switch activities without shame.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Somatic integration is only for trauma; If you track sensations, sex becomes less spontaneous; Body awareness should override verbal consent; Somatic work replaces medical care when symptoms persist.",Aftercare; Consent; Arousal Window; Emotional Safety; Cognitive and Somatic Dissonance,somatic-integration; body-awareness; nervous-system-regulation; consent-check-in; pleasure-skills; intimacy

It often strengthens bonding, reduces pressure, and improves resilience during life stages when frequency or performance changes. It does not exclude orgasm or novelty-it simply broadens what ""counts"" as rewarding.",Enjoying slow kissing and touch even without escalation; Feeling satisfied from emotional closeness and aftercare; Valuing playfulness and safety as core rewards of intimacy.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"State-based reward means low desire; State-based reward is less ""real"" than orgasm; If you focus on states, you should never want novelty; State-based reward removes the need to discuss preferences.",Event-Based Reward; Flow States; Aftercare; Emotional Intimacy; Presence vs Performance,state-based-reward; connection; process-over-outcome; intimacy; satisfaction
105,Structured Action → Integration Sequence,Practice & Skill,"A change pathway where people take small, specific actions and then integrate learning through reflection, feedback, and repetition until it becomes a stable skill.","This sequence avoids “insight-only” loops by turning understanding into practice (e.g., one new communication habit per week). Integration includes aftercare, repair, and review so change remains consent-centered and sustainable across life stages and cultural contexts.","Try one new consent check-in phrase, then debrief what worked; Practice a pacing adjustment, then integrate it into your initiation routine; Use monthly check-ins to stabilize new intimacy habits.",Relationship Dynamics & Intimacy,General,Action without reflection leads to pressure; Integration means suppressing desire; A single action step should fix everything; Structured change makes intimacy robotic.,Longitudinal Check-ins; Feedback Loops; Reflective Prompts; Embodied Integration; State Optimization,action-integration; habit-formation; relationship-skills; intimacy-practice; behavior-change; sustainable-growth
106,Suppression of Rare Combinations,Data & Research Method,A privacy method that removes or masks data records/fields that become identifying due to rare attribute combinations.,"This is especially important for small samples, small countries/regions, or minority subgroups where uniqueness is common. Suppression can be paired with aggregation/coarsening and controlled access to protect users while allowing responsible research.",Masking cells where fewer than a minimum number of users appear; Removing an uncommon job title from exports; Suppressing cross-tabs that reveal unique combinations.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,Suppression is data manipulation and always wrong; Rare combinations don’t matter if names are removed; Suppression alone solves privacy; Suppression makes findings invalid automatically.,Aggregation & Coarsening; Quasi-Identifiers; Re-Identification Risk; Controlled Research Environments,suppression; rare-combinations; privacy-preserving; small-samples; disclosure-control; safe-analytics
107,Systemic Gap in Sexual Education,Pattern & Dynamic,"A widespread shortfall in sexual education that leaves many people without practical, evidence-based knowledge about bodies, consent, pleasure, and healthy relationship skills.","A systemic education gap is not just “missing information”—it often creates myths, shame, and unrealistic expectations that shape adult intimacy and communication. The size and content of the gap varies by country, school system, and community, but the outcome is similar: people learn from peers, porn, or trial-and-error instead of guided, accurate learning. Closing the gap usually involves normalizing questions, teaching consent and anatomy, and building communication skills.",Adults who never learned accurate anatomy and struggle to describe what feels good; Partners who assume consent is “obvious” because no one taught explicit boundary skills; People who feel confused about arousal changes across the lifespan because education focused only on reproduction.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,General,"If you had biology class, you’re fully educated about sex; Sex education is only about preventing pregnancy and STIs; Good sex is instinctive so education is unnecessary; A systemic gap is an individual’s fault.",Consent; Boundaries; Sexual Script; Desire; Aftercare,sex-education-gap; sexual-health-literacy; consent-skills; anatomy-knowledge; relationship-education; pleasure-and-wellbeing
108,Targeted Boosts,Data & Research Method,"Rule-based adjustments that slightly increase (or decrease) scores for specific dimensions to reflect user priorities, context, or safety considerations.","Boosts can support personalization—for example, emphasizing compatibility on communication style for people who value directness. They should be bounded and auditable to avoid hidden manipulation. In international products, boosts may also be used to support local cultural calibration while preserving core consent and safety standards.",Boosting matches with similar initiation style for users who report high importance of communication; Reducing scores when a key boundary preference conflicts; Increasing weight on relationship form preference in regions where exclusivity norms differ.,Product & Assessment,General,Boosts are the same as cheating the model; Boosts should override user consent preferences; Boosts guarantee better outcomes; Boosts remove the need for validity testing.,Dimension Weights; Gates / Guardrails; Compatibility Engine; Bias; Validity; Reliability,targeted-boosts; personalization; scoring-adjustments; matching-system; cultural-calibration; safety
109,Tiered Access Approach,Framework & Model,"A governance model that provides different levels of data access based on sensitivity, risk, and role (e.g., user, analyst, researcher).","Tiering typically means: highly sensitive data is tightly restricted; less sensitive aggregates are more widely shareable. This approach supports geo-ready reporting and research partnerships while protecting users through least-privilege access, auditing, and guardrails.",User sees their own detailed results; Internal analysts see de-identified aggregates; External researchers only access controlled outputs or heavily coarsened datasets.,"Data, Privacy & Measurement",General,"Tiered access is just bureaucracy; If data is anonymized, tiering is unnecessary; Tiering replaces consent; Tiering guarantees there is no risk.",Gates / Guardrails; Controlled Research Environments; Anonymized Research Access; Direct Identifiers,tiered-access; data-governance; least-privilege; privacy-by-design; research-sharing; compliance
110,Trial-and-Error Sexuality,Pattern & Dynamic,"A learning pattern where people develop sexual knowledge mainly through experimentation without guidance, often increasing confusion, shame, or mismatch.","Trial-and-error can be normal, but when it’s the primary pathway (due to taboo or poor education), it can create avoidable harm: misread consent, unrealistic expectations, and difficulty communicating needs. Supportive alternatives include education, reflective prompts, and consent-centered conversations that reduce risk and build confidence.",Learning boundaries only after an uncomfortable experience; Couples repeating patterns that don’t work because they can’t name preferences; Confusing arousal with consent due to lack of guidance.,Pleasure & Sexual Wellbeing,Sensitive,"Trial-and-error is the only way to learn; If sex is awkward, you’re incompatible; Guidance kills spontaneity; Communication is unnecessary if there is attraction.",Consent Frameworks; Reflective Prompts; Sexual Confidence; Signal Mismatch; Systemic Gap in Sexual Education,trial-and-error; sexual-learning; intimacy-skills; consent-education; communication; wellbeing
111,Typical Sexual Fantasies,Trait & Disposition,"The recurring fantasy themes or scenarios a person tends to find erotic, which may or may not match what they want in real life.","Fantasy themes can involve novelty, power, romance, taboo, tenderness, or role play, and they are shaped by learning, culture, and personal history. Having a fantasy does not equal wanting to act it out; consent and boundaries always apply. Talking about fantasies can deepen intimacy when approached with curiosity, privacy, and clear agreements.",Someone enjoys “stranger” novelty fantasies while preferring monogamy in life; A person has power-play fantasies but keeps them within negotiated role play; Partners share a romantic storyline fantasy to increase arousal.,"Fantasy, Kink & Exploration",Highly Sensitive,"Fantasies reveal real-world intentions; If you fantasize about something, you must do it; Fantasies are abnormal and shameful; Sharing fantasies means you are dissatisfied with your partner.",Sexual Shadow; Fantasy; Role Play; Roleplay Boundaries; Consent; Fantasy Comfort,sexual-fantasies; erotic-fantasy-themes; fantasy-vs-reality; roleplay; kink-curiosity; private-intimacy
112,Vagus Nerve,Data & Research Method,"A major nerve connecting brain and body that supports regulation of heart rate, breathing, digestion, and social engagement—important for calming into intimacy.","The vagus nerve is often discussed as part of polyvagal ideas and “rest-and-digest” functioning. Practices like slow exhale breathing, humming, and gentle movement can support vagal tone for some people, though effects vary and are not a replacement for medical care. In relationships, feeling safe and connected is one of the most reliable ways to support regulation.",Using slower breathing to reduce anxiety before initiating sex; Noticing that emotional reassurance changes bodily tension quickly; Taking a warm shower or stretching to shift from stress into relaxation.,Emotional & Attachment Patterns,General,"You can “hack” the vagus nerve to fix everything; Vagal exercises guarantee increased libido; If someone can’t relax, they aren’t trying; Vagus nerve concepts replace professional health support.",Polyvagal Theory; Autonomic Nervous System (ANS); Somatic Integration; Arousal Brake; Emotional Safety,vagus-nerve; vagal-tone; nervous-system-regulation; relaxation; intimacy-readiness; stress
